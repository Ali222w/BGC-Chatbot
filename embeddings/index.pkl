Note From BGC Managing Director  
Safety is good for Business and is at the core of everything we do in 
BGC.  
Our aim is to protect and safeguard our employees, contractors, the 
environment, our communities and BGC‚Äôs assets. It is therefore essential 
that we all know and comply with the BGC HSE requirements. We all 
have the responsibility to protect ourselves and others. 
The WMP is a manual that communicates our HSE requirements and 
best practices and focusses on what is really needed at the work front to 
keep people safe.  
This version 2 of the WMP captures learnings since the implementation of Version 1 and 
improvement & simplification feedback received from the Business from using the WMP in 
the field over the last year. 
Scope of the WMP 
‚Ä¢ The WMP captures key activities completed by frontline BGC staff and contractors.îhh	uhNhèî(hhhêhNubå$849b1e38-500a-4177-8068-06d1271232fcîh

Scope of the WMP 
‚Ä¢ The WMP captures key activities completed by frontline BGC staff and contractors. 
Activities conducted by specialized contractors only (e.g. Ionizing Radiation, Tank Cleaning, 
Asbestos Category 2) may have additional requirements. 
Implementation: Roles & Responsibilities 
‚Ä¢ All BGC and contractors are responsible for following the WMP requirements. If anyone 
sees these requirements not being followed, they must safely intervene. 
‚Ä¢ Line Managers (BGC and Contractors) are responsible for ensuring these requirements are 
available to workers and appropriate supervision and control is in place (including Permit-
To Work (PTW), where required) to check that the requirements are understood and 
implemented. 
‚Ä¢ Plant, Site and Facility Managers are responsible for confirming that works undertaken on 
their area of responsibility are confirmed as being in accordance with BGC WMPs.

their area of responsibility are confirmed as being in accordance with BGC WMPs. 
Training & Competencies 
‚Ä¢ A number of WMP sections define activity specific training and competence requirements 
(e.g. WMP #25 PTW) staff and contractors have to meet enabling them to conduct these 
activities safely. 
‚Ä¢ On top of these specific requirements as a minimum all BGC staff and contractors shall

2.3  For Breaking Containment on a system which has already been spaded in close proximity, (less 
than 5m as a guide), to the work (for example removing an already spaded pump), then there 
is no requirement for a Breaking Containment permit, as containment has already been broken 
previously (along with DFPV) for inserting the spades. This should be highlighted in the special 
precautions section of the permit used and highlighted during the toolbox talk 
2.4  For breaking containment on systems containing non-hazardous materials (for example air or 
water) then there is no requirement for a Breaking Containment permit. However, a JHA 
should be considered to identify the hazards and controls, particularly in systems which have a 
pressure envelope, for example instrument air.

2.5  Breaking Containment Confined Space (#3 Confined Space Entry) or Excavation (#7 
Excavation)has it‚Äôs own hazards to consider, which need to be accounted for in the 
JHA 
2.6  Breaking containment of flare systems has specific N2 purging requirements which are 
described in Draining, Flushing, Purging & Venting procedure (OMP18). 
3. Do The Work  
3.1  Before Starting the Work 
Ensure that there no conflicting Manual of Operatrions (MOPO) or Simultaneous Operations 
(SIMOPS) review is conducted in the PTW office, to ensure there are no conflicting activities in 
close proximity to where the breaking containment will take place. Some examples of conflicts 
could be : 
‚Ä¢ Hot Work 1 within 50m of the Breaking Containment (HC gas from the Breaking 
Containment could migrate to the HW site and cause a fire or explosion) 
‚Ä¢ Excavations in close proximity (HC‚Äôs or H2S from the Breaking Containment could migrateîhh	uhNhèî(hhhêhNubå$21c10991-501a-417c-8b02-ba1c471709a4îh

‚Ä¢ Excavations in close proximity (HC‚Äôs or H2S from the Breaking Containment could migrate 
to the excavation and cause harm to the workers) 
‚Ä¢ Lifting operations in close proximity (HC‚Äôs from the Breaking Containment could migrate to 
the crane and cause an explosion) 
Work at Height (WAH) in close proximity (gases from the Breaking Containment 
may impede the WAH party from escaping the area safely). 
3.2  The following steps shall be followed and are the responsibility of Operations: 
‚Ä¢ Execution of the isolation plan (OMP14) 
‚Ä¢ Execution of the Draining, Flaring, Purging, Venting (DVPF) plan (OMP18): 
o Reduce pressure.  
o Aid removal of liquids to the closed drain system.  
o Remove hazardous liquids.  
o Remove hazardous vapours by depressurisation.  
o Flush.  
o Purge with nitrogen (if applicable)  
Purge with air if required.îhh	uhNhèî(hhhêhNubå$ab9c6a2f-fa78-47d6-9170-310336f1f153îh

3.3  When it‚Äôs not reasonably practicable to depressurize the equipment or make it free of 
hazardous fluids prior to breaking containment, local procedures must be put in place to 
ensure that the work parties who are involved in breaking the containment are informed of the 
nature of the (possible) residual hazard along with the basic safety precautions that are 
required to control the hazard.îhh	uhNhèî(hhhêhNubå$de863841-a1da-4678-a071-b50eb8ee890bîh

Work Management Procedure 
#4 Driving Safety & Journey Management 
1. Overview and Hazards 
1.1 The purpose of this WMP is to ensure personnel involved in driving understand the 
potential hazards and apply controls to reduce incidents from driving and 
transportation.   
 
This WMP applies to all BGC arranged transport on road for BGC personnel, contractors and 
subcontractors who transport people and materials for BGC business. 
 
Use of private vehicles on company business is strictly prohibited. People traveling for business 
between sites should use company provided vehicles. Private vehicles should only be used for 
commuting and commuting is not scope of this WMP unless it is arranged by company provided 
vehicles.  
 
 
 
 
Commuting vs Business Travel 
Commuting is the journey from home to the designated BGC work location and the journeyîhh	uhNhèî(hhhêhNubå$a04797c7-fc76-47f9-b8dd-7d7e7430af22îh

Work Management Procedure 
#5 Emergency Response 
1. Overview and Hazards 
1.1 BGC‚Äôs Emergency Response Plans (ERP) describe the arrangements in place to respond to an 
emergency within its area of operations. The BGC emergency response capability has been 
established to ensure a prompt and appropriate response to an emergency, to mitigate the 
consequences of an emergency and promote the return to normal and safe operations. 
Each BGC facility or site has its own ERP. Refer to the respective worksite ERP in case of 
incidents that require emergency response activation.   
 
This WMP section is only applicable to all non-ER BGC staff and contractors and covers

Work Management Procedure 
#6 Electrical Safety  
1. Overview and Hazards 
1.1 This WMP provides awareness and guidance how to  manage risks and hazards associated 
with electricity when operating and / or working on electrical systems. 
BGC has developed Electrical Safety Rules (ESR) and Electrical Safety Operating 
Procedures (ESOP) to manage the risks and hazards associated with electricity when 
operating and / or working on electrical systems. The ESR/ESOP mandates the minimum 
requirements to ensure safe work methods and practices are adopted for work across 
BGC‚Äôs electrical systems. The ESR/ESOP are applicable to any part of the electrical power 
generation and distribution system in the production and processing facilities, 
accommodations, and logistics bases across BGC (including temporary facilities andîhh	uhNhèî(hhhêhNubå$ce6cb7d4-4cdd-4aaf-9a92-29ed673dfae3îh

accommodations, and logistics bases across BGC (including temporary facilities and 
mobile / portable equipment). Within BGC the application of the ESR is mandatory and 
shall be always followed.  
1.2 Hazards 
 Electricity is a significant hazard. If work is not planned and done correctly this can lead to 
harm to people and environment and / or damage to equipment, facilities or buildings.  
‚Ä¢ Direct contact with electrical current can be deadly. While some electrical burns look 
minor, there still may be serious internal damage, especially to the heart, muscles, or 
brain. Electric current can cause injury in four ways: 
o Cardiac arrest due to the electrical effect on the heart 
o Muscle, nerve, and tissue destruction from a current passing through the body 
o Thermal burns from contact with the electrical source 
o Falling or injury after contact with electricityîhh	uhNhèî(hhhêhNubå$68c1bbbf-813e-4173-b54d-4550fc5ebb8fîh

o Thermal burns from contact with the electrical source 
o Falling or injury after contact with electricity 
‚Ä¢ Electricity operating at higher voltages can cause a spark to jump, initiating an arc flash 
without the need for physical contact. This can lead to the injuries as listed above and 
can also cause injuries to eyesight from the ‚Äòflash‚Äô associated with the arc. 
‚Ä¢ Overheating of equipment, fires or ignition of explosive atmospheres 
‚Ä¢ Some electrical systems are critical for the safe operation of equipment. If electrical 
systems are not correctly designed, installed, maintained, repaired, and protected from 
damage, the failure of that equipment can subsequently lead to harm or damage 
‚Ä¢ It is possible for stray electrical currents to be present, where equipment has not been 
properly designed, installed, maintained, repaired or damagedîhh	uhNhèî(hhhêhNubå$94ed023f-f6c1-48c8-99c8-bb3d078664bbîh

Appendix 4 Ground Penetration Radar (GPR)  
  
Purpose 
The purpose of this addendum is to demonstrate the advantages in using Ground 
Penetration Radar (GPR) with mechanical excavation to reduce traditional manual / 
hydrovac excavation. The tool shows a positive impact to HSE exposure, schedule, and 
cost. The development of the GPR technology has made it possible to detect UG 
obstacles using proper trained GPR operators and trials at BGC locations and other IOC 
companies in IRAQ show that with the high-level accuracy of GPR and the use of 100% 
hydrovac pilot trenching with manual excavation can be significantly reduced.  
Procedure 
The following steps explain the use of GPR: 
 
1- First step will be for the contractor personnel to mark out as per AFC drawings the 
proposed cable or pipe trench area. The area to be scanned will be increased with 1mîhh	uhNhèî(hhhêhNubå$369a4ff1-07a2-46e7-9389-6cc342c636a4îh

proposed cable or pipe trench area. The area to be scanned will be increased with 1m 
on both sides of the planned excavation area. (see figure 1). This will be done using 
white chalk marked on the ground, so the alignment/trench area is clearly visible. Any

2- Second step will be once the alignment /route of the service ie cable/pipe is marked 
on the ground joint walkdown will be conducted with BGC and Contractor to verify 
and resolve any clashes if any. 
 
 
3- Third step will be that the contractors‚Äô personnel will carry out a site survey using 
Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) scan device to survey and identify if there are any 
underground services in area of the trench to be excavated as shown in Figure-2. The 
scan will go beyond the proposed area of excavation by 1m to give assurance and 
safeguard if any existing service are going towards the trench excavation.

5- If there are any underground services detected the contactor will mark the location of 
the services on the ground from the GPR survey report by using spray paint, fixing 
stakes or flags pins. This will assist the operators when hydrovac to take extra 
precautions when coming up the underground service 
 
 
6- Once the underground services have been marked on the ground the work crew will 
commence the Hydrovac works by completing shallow vertical trenches, 2 meter or 
less depth with 15 cm wide slots to expose the identified UG services. 
 
 
7- Manual and hydrovac excavation will be done to 1 m from the identified UG services 
and to the required depth. Upon underground services being exposed /visible, the 
BGC / Contractor will walkdown and inspect to review for the next stage of excavation 
which will be mechanical excavation (no services) or manual excavation.îhh	uhNhèî(hhhêhNubå$31c2fbcc-375c-4596-8ee7-e41c8ed30800îh

8- If no underground services are found with the GPR, mechanical excavation can 
commence, no hydrovac is needed. Mechanical excavation for the cleared area must 
be done with close monitoring from competent supervisor at the site. Mechanical 
excavation will no t be used within 2m of any live pipelines or within 1 metre 
horizontally of any utility until it is fully hand exposed.  
Note: traditional p ilot trenching is still captured in the excavation procedure under 6.1.2.

#10 Handling Asbestos 
 
1 Overview and Hazards 
1.1 This WMP describes the requirements for safe handling and disposal of Asbestos and 
Refractory Ceramic Fibers (RCF) Containing Materials A/RCF CM, during construction 
works and maintenance works.   
‚Ä¢ Asbestos is a naturally occurring fibrous silicate which is extracted from the earth by 
mining and then usually incorporated with other materials. It is used to form a large 
range of materials such as cement products, insulation materials, textiles, tiles, 
papers, fireproofing, building panels, brake linings, gaskets and many others. 
‚Ä¢ The introduction of new A/RCF CM is not permitted, use free A/RCF CM (i.e. glass

1 OVERVIEW AND HAZARDS 
1.1 Chemicals can cause unwanted health effects 
such as skin irritation, breathing difficulties, 
injury, etc. Chemicals may be flammable, 
poisonous, corrosive or very harmful to both 
people and the environment. The purpose of this 
WMP is to ensure safe handling, use, storage, 
transportation and disposal of chemicals used at 
BGC.  
 
 
1.2 Harmful effects from chemicals vary greatly. Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) must be 
referred to so that the specific hazards can be understood and mitigated.

#13 Hazard Identification 
 
1 Overview and Hazards 
1.1 A Hazard is any situation, condition, material, substance or object that has the potential 
to cause harm to people, damage to assets, effect on the environment, impact to 
community, or damage BGC‚Äôs reputation. The purpose of this WMP is to ensure the right 
steps are followed to recognize hazards at worksites.  
Overarching hazards recognized in BGC operating assets are documented and managed 
through HSE Cases.  
‚Ä¢ HSE cases are developed, available at BGC operating sites and updated periodically; 
‚Ä¢ The HSE Case is a facility or operation-specific demonstration that the HSE risks from 
Major Hazards are managed to As Low As Reasonably Practicable (ALARP)and a 
description on how the HSE Management System is applied to manage HSE hazards;îhh	uhNhèî(hhhêhNubå$188d92de-4c27-4356-b1da-29c4def9554eîh

description on how the HSE Management System is applied to manage HSE hazards; 
‚Ä¢ Within the HSE Case several risks and hazards management tools are used, such as 
Hazards Identification (HAZID), Hazards Operability (HAZOP), Quantitative Risk 
Assessment (QRA), Health Risk Assessment (HRA) and Qualitative Risk Assessment. 
 
Activity specific tools such as Job Hazards Analysis (JHA), 7 STEPS and Worksite Hazards 
Management are used during day-to-day work in facilities.  
 
In BGC we apply a Hazard and Effects Management Process (HEMP)  following the below 
steps: 
‚Ä¢ Identification, risk assessment and control of Hazards; 
‚Ä¢ Evaluation and implementation of barriers (control and recovery measures); 
‚Ä¢ Documentation within HSE Cases that major HSE risks have been reduced to ALARP. 
 
 
1.2 HEMP tools are used in design and plant changes but also for the day-to-day worksite 
activities.îhh	uhNhèî(hhhêhNubå$503e980c-abe0-4d2e-9679-bf6a39f18974îh

#14 Health Management of Hydrocarbons in Air (BTEX) 
 
1 Overview and Hazards  
1.1 Benzene, Toluene, Ethyl Benzene and Xylene (BTEX) are aromatic hydrocarbon compounds 
that occur naturally in crude oil and gas. They are components of a wide range of Volatile 
Organic Compounds (VOCs) that are detectable by smell. 
BGC‚Äôs precautions follow industry standards, to limit exposure and ensure care for people‚Äôs 
health. Projects are underway in BGC to further limit exposure potential where required. 
1.2 Hazards 
 The component of highest concern is benzene due to its carcinogenic health risk.   
‚Ä¢ Consequently, Workplace Exposure Limit (WEL) and ambient air quality standards are set 
at very stringent concentrations. 
‚Ä¢ Monitoring VOC and BTEX concentrations show safe occupational levels across the vastîhh	uhNhèî(hhhêhNubå$888c6440-0a9f-4d74-b958-3c00c070b756îh

‚Ä¢ Monitoring VOC and BTEX concentrations show safe occupational levels across the vast 
majority of BGCs operations and situations. Despite this some people may experience 
discomfort from VOC odour at particular times and conditions, and extra mitigation is 
needed in specific locations and conditions.  
‚Ä¢ People may feel short term discomfort (like headache, sore throat, sore eyes) if they 
remain directly downwind of venting odour for extended periods. 
 
 Relevant Life Saving Rules and Process Safety Fundamentals 
 
  
 
  
 
2  Plan The Work  
2.1  Follow WMP #13 Hazard Identification to identify the hazards of the task and the location and

2.18  Precautions 
Personnel shall comply to the requirements stated in BGC Manuals Of Permitted Operations 
(MOPO). These are available at the PTW desks and the PTW Issuer ensures work 
permits are issued or revoked accordingly. 
The heat stress status of the environment is monitored between 1st May and the 
last day of September. Measurements are communicated to PTW desks and key personnel by 
HSE support personnel daily at 09:00, 13:00 and 15:00. 
Assessment of the heat stress status is done by measuring the ambient temperature (¬∞C) and 
the Relative Humidity (RH). The results are then inputted into the Heat Index Matrix to 
determine the Heat Index (in ¬∞C).

3.1  Extreme Hot Weather 
Prevention of heat related illness is critical for all employees, contractors and sub-contractors, 
particularly during the summer months (when temperatures are commonly and above 40¬∞C 
and can be accompanied by high humidity levels).   
3.2  Failure to advise personnel of the dangers of heat stress, how to manage exposure and to 
implement this procedure could lead to injury, illness or even death. 
3.3  The body‚Äôs response to high heat exposure manifests in a range of conditions including rashes, 
cramps, heat stress, and the most severe, heat stroke (which is a medical emergency). In 
addition, dizziness or fainting as a result of heat exposure may result in more serious injury or 
incident if the individual affected may have been operating machinery, controlling an 
operation or working at height etc.

An overview of Health Conditions, Symptoms and Treatment is given in Appendix 1. 
3.4  Workplace, Task Evaluation and Risk Assessment 
For most workplaces and tasks observation of the flag colour and implementing all the 
standard controls identified in this procedure provide adequate control of the heat stress risk 
associated with working in BGC‚Äôs facilities. Work with an elevated risk for heat 
stress shall be identified as part of preparing the PTW and associated documents.  
Some examples are:  
‚Ä¢ Confined Space Entry (CSE) or elevated work; 
‚Ä¢ Tasks that require the use of specific PPE such as respirators, facemasks, 
insulated clothing etc; 
‚Ä¢ Any job or task that requires strenuous physical activity; 
‚Ä¢ Work near radiant heat sources. 
 
If needed, preparation of this type of work can be supported by HSE personnel with the input 
from BGC Medical and Occupational Health Department.

Work Management Procedure 
#16 Hot Work 
 
1 Overview and Hazards 
1.1 Hot Work includes activities such as welding, cutting, heating, use of lighting 
towers and descaling as examples. The purpose of this WMP is to ensure 
personnel involved in Hot Work activities understand the potential hazards and 
apply controls to reduce the risks of incidents from fires and explosions.  
 
Non-hydrocarbon facilities in BGC like workshops and fabrication yards will be 
considered as non-hazardous areas as defined in this WMP. 
1.2 Hazards include: 
 ‚Ä¢ Increased risk of fire and/or explosion due to the presence of flammable products in 
large volumes and high pressures; 
‚Ä¢ Fire caused by heat, sparks, molten metal or direct contact with the flame; 
‚Ä¢ Explosion e.g. when cutting up or repairing tanks or drums which contain or may 
have contained flammable materials;îhh	uhNhèî(hhhêhNubå$8aa307b0-a181-4c1d-a27b-c83cdc2579acîh

2  Plan The Work  
2.1  Follow WMP #13 Hazard Identification to identify the Hazards of the task and the 
location. Apply the Hierarchy of Controls to ensure that the most appropriate controls 
have been selected. 
2.2  Hot Work activities must always be performed under a Permit-To-Work (PTW) 
unless the work is performed in a dedicated asset workshop or fabrication yard 
outside the process area, where a risk assessment is required for the specific tasks.   
 ‚Ä¢ Projects require PTW (general or specific) for all Hot Work activities irrespective of 
location. Follow WMP #25 PTW. 
2.3 Hot Work can be defined in two categories: 
‚Ä¢ Category 1: A positive source of ignition (there will definitely be a source of ignition) 
‚Ä¢ Category 2: A potential source of ignition (there will possibly be a source of ignition)îhh	uhNhèî(hhhêhNubå$c1a3285a-1622-476c-a4af-f2cd3d5b105eîh

process equipment like pumps and 
compressors. 
Unclassified 
Areas in which flammable atmospheres 
are not expected to be present.  
Areas outside Zone 2 areas but still within 
the Process Areas boundary 
Non-Process 
Area

2.5  When planning work activities, make field checks and confirm with Operations the 
Hazardous Zone Area identified on the HAC drawing. The HAC may change due to 
operational conditions e.g. due to a leaking valve or flange. 
2.6  If HAC drawings are not available, if a leak is identified, then a risk assessment 
must be conducted to determine the likely Zone Classification and mitigations.   
Speak with the Permit Issuer and DO NOT PROCEED until the Zone Classification has been 
confirmed. Check that the work location‚Äôs HAC Zone allows the planned Hot Work 
Category to be conducted. See Table 3 and Table 4 below:

 ZONE 0:  No Hot Work can occur unless the sources of hydrocarbon that classify the area as 
 Zone 0 can be fully isolated and zone classification can be temporarily rendered to 
 Zone 1 or Zone 2. The only exception to this is hot tapping, see section 3.9. 
ZONE 1: PTW with appropriate Hot Work controls such as gas testing, no 
 flammable substances in area, use of pressurised habitat. Provide 
 attention to containment of ignition sources such as sparks.  
Hot Work shall only be carried out when a Pressurised Habitat (Safe Habitat) is used. 
ZONE 2: PTW with appropriate Hot Work controls, see Table 4.

Work Management Procedure 
#17 Housekeeping 
 
1 Overview and Hazards  
1.1 Housekeeping is a practical method of creating a safer workplace and reducing 
incidents by keeping the work area free of obstruction and waste. Good 
housekeeping reflects the level of professionalism and standards of its staff and it 
prevents accidents at work. 
Good housekeeping practices begin in the office and this behaviour shall extend to 
the way worksites are managed. This WMP establishes the minimum requirements 
and provides safe working practices for housekeeping. 
1.2 Hazards Include 
 ‚ñ™ Slips, trips and falls from poorly stored materials and waste / debris 
 ‚ñ™ Increased fire risk from blocked fire exit routes, flammable materials incorrectly 
stored and waste / debris 
 ‚ñ™ Damage to the environment from discarded materials, leaking fluids, poorly stored 
materials and waste / debrisîhh	uhNhèî(hhhêhNubå$9e0410da-bd94-40e6-9838-048ab9de5285îh

2.4  Housekeeping activities in process areas will be included within the permit for the task and 
/ or the Job Hazard Analysis (JHA). Team Leads and Supervisors must determine what is 
required to ensure good housekeeping during the work. They must ensure all 
team members understand their responsibility to maintain their work areas in a 
clean and orderly manner. Follow WMP #25 Permit to Work.  
2.5  Plan for storage of material, supplies and waste that considers the movement (flow) of 
personnel, equipment (e.g. Hi-ab / Bin lorry), materials, fire hazards, and clear routes for 
evacuation, firefighting and rescue as well as movement. Waste areas must be allocated 
for temporary storage/stockpiling/ segregation of materials.

Work Management Procedure 
#18 HSE Event Reporting, Investigation and Learning 
 
1 Overview and Hazards 
1.1 The purpose of this WMP is to ensure the correct action is taken after the occurrence of 
an HSE Event. An HSE Event is an unplanned event or chain of events that has, or could 
have, resulted in injury or illness, damage to our assets, the environment or an impact to 
our communities. 
All HSE Events including HSE incidents, Near Misses and Observations (incl unsafe 
act/conditions RAM3+) related to our activities shall be reported and investigated so that 
further risk can be mitigated, actions can be taken to prevent recurrence and to enable 
compliance with regulatory requirements and BGC standards. 
1.2 Hazards 
If HSE Events are not appropriately reported and investigated, then it is possible that:

If HSE Events are not appropriately reported and investigated, then it is possible that: 
‚Ä¢ The learning from a ‚ÄòNear Miss‚Äô incident may not be 
applied and may be repeated, with possibly more 
significant consequences; 
‚Ä¢ An HSE Event can escalate into a worse outcome; 
‚Ä¢ An Injured Person (IP) may not get the treatment that they 
need; 
‚Ä¢ The HSE Event may be repeated if potential problems are not corrected. 
 
Relevant Life Saving Rules and Process Safety Fundamentals 
Note: All Life Saving Rules & Process Safety Fundamentals are applicable for this 
WMP section. 
 
2  Plan The Work: Ensure Requirements are Known 
2.1  All HSE Events are to be reported to the Supervisor of the work activity and Section Head 
in the operating facilities accordance to the timelines in Appendix 1. 
2.2  If there is any doubt as to whether the illness or injury is work related or not, or whether 
the illness or injury is significant, the HSE Event needs to be reported. Initial details canîhh	uhNhèî(hhhêhNubå$ea4d46bf-e749-49ac-9612-8b303bc03447îh

2.3  The BGC Risk Assessment Matrix (RAM) is used to determine incident severity or 
potential severity, see WMP #13 Hazard Identification for the RAM. 
2.4  HSE Event Owner  
The person in the organization who has control over the work activity where the incident 
occurred. The following order takes precedence to define ownership for the work 
activity: 
‚Ä¢ Organization that issues the work permit (i.e. Asset, Projects, Logistics, etc); 
‚Ä¢ Organisation that is the budget holder for the work being done at the time; 
‚Ä¢ Where there is no work permit or budget-ownership is unclear, the Event Owner is 
the organization responsible for the area (e.g. facility, construction site, office 
buildings); 
‚Ä¢ If the above is not applicable, for BGC staff the Event Owner is the Line Manager of 
the IP and for contractors the Event Owner is the Contract Holder.îhh	uhNhèî(hhhêhNubå$8698e51f-8abf-4a74-a7ef-52e069e13b85îh

the IP and for contractors the Event Owner is the Contract Holder. 
2.5  HSE Event Owner Accountabilities 
‚Ä¢ Make the incident site safe and make decision on work continuation or suspension; 
‚Ä¢ Report the incident using the DLBGCIncident-Notification@basrahgas.iq distribution list 
(Appendix 2) or report directly into SpheraCloud within 24hrs; 
‚Ä¢ Manage and initiate the incident investigation including reviewing the investigation 
report, approve or obtain approval for the plan and action follow up until 
completion; 
‚Ä¢ Obtain legal advice before beginning to write any investigation report that may need 
to be shared with external parties and obtain legal review before it is finally 
approved; 
‚Ä¢ Ensure that:

#19 Hydrogen Sulphide (H2S) 
 
1  Overview and Hazards 
1.1 1
.
1 
Hydrogen Sulphide (H2S) gas is extremely hazardous. It smells like rotten eggs at low 
concentrations. It is heavier than air so accumulates in low-lying areas. H2S can be 
present in production gas and may be released through leaks or vents and drains, when 
opening or purging equipment. Table 1 summarises the health and hazardous effects of 
H2S. 
Table 1 H2S Health Effects 
OEL (ppm in air)  Health Effects  
 <1 ppm Smell like rotten eggs detectable by most people at anytime 
 10-50 ppm Burning in eyes, nose, throat, and airways. Rotten egg smell disappears 
 50-100ppm Loss of sense of smell after 15 mins,  
Up to 1 hour exposure, headaches, dizziness, loss of balance serious eye 
irritation or damage, lungs begin to fill with fluidîhh	uhNhèî(hhhêhNubå$b5dffd29-4ac5-456e-9a9c-9a1135b44242îh

}î(hj¿  h}î(hhhKvuhXÌ  50-100ppm Loss of sense of smell after 15 mins,  
Up to 1 hour exposure, headaches, dizziness, loss of balance serious eye 
irritation or damage, lungs begin to fill with fluid 
 100 ppm After 3 ‚Äì 15 mins, completely lose sense of smell, coughing, dizziness, eye 
pain and damage, difficulty breathing, drowsiness. Impair an individual‚Äôs 
ability to escape from a dangerous atmosphere. Immediately Dangerous to 
Life and Health (IDLH) level  
 200 ppm Lungs quickly fill with fluid, cannot breathe 
 >500 ppm Unconsciousness followed by death if not quickly rescued 
 >1000 ppm Breathing stops within one or two breaths, death within 3 minutes 
 
H2S Hazardous Effects 
 
 
Toxic ‚Äì creates poisonous atmospheres that cause serious illness or death 
 
Flammable ‚Äì when released to the atmosphere they can catch fire or explode 
 
 
Corrosive ‚Äì causes skin and eye damage, and can cause damage to certain materials 
 
 
Inert/asphyxiating displaces oxygen from a space, making breathing impossibleîhh	uhNhèî(hhhêhNubå$6ed45219-c686-4dd7-a799-759ce7857776îh

Inert/asphyxiating displaces oxygen from a space, making breathing impossible 
1.2 H2S in hydrocarbon systems can also cause the production of pyrophoric material (also 
known as iron sulphide or black sludge deposit). Pyrophoric material can ignite suddenly 
when exposed to air. Consider this hazard when opening equipment and dealing with 
pyrophoric sludges and scales. If H2S catches fire, it will produce sulphur dioxide, which is 
highly toxic.îhh	uhNhèî(hhhêhNubå$f66972ff-fa24-4ee6-acc2-56618760e363îh

2  Plan The Work  
2.1  Follow WMP #13 Hazard Identification to identify the hazards of the task and the 
location. Apply the Hierarchy of Controls   to ensure that the most appropriate controls 
have been selected. 
2.2  Hazard Management 
For Job Hazard Analysis (JHA) and Permit-To-Work (PTW) application:  
‚Ä¢ Identify the potential sources and concentrations of H2S  
‚Ä¢ Identify the events that might result in the release H2S 
Ensure any equipment removed from sour service must be thoroughly isolated/ 
purged/flushed to ensure no remnants of H2S are introduced during transport or in the 
workshop.  
2.3  H2S Areas (Sour Facilities) 
In BGC facilities operate either with (sour) or without risk of H2S (always verify with 
operations before you do work).îhh	uhNhèî(hhhêhNubå$487d3959-ae86-4d61-8490-c59932f7b1bfîh

2.3  H2S Areas (Sour Facilities) 
In BGC facilities operate either with (sour) or without risk of H2S (always verify with 
operations before you do work).  
‚Ä¢ Classification of H2S Area may change if sampling confirms H2S exceeds thresholds. 
‚Ä¢ Place clear warning signs and barriers at the entrance and surrounding H2S risk areas. 
 
2.4  Access Control and entry requirements to H2S Risk Areas 
Personnel planning to access BGC hydrocarbon facilities with H2S must go through the 
normal site orientation process. Area Owners must ensure processes are in place in their 
area of authority that:  
‚Ä¢ Access control is in place to stop personnel not meeting below requirements 
‚Ä¢ Personnel are informed about H2S presence and emergency response requirement 
‚Ä¢ Validity of their training is verified (see Table 2)

#20 Isolations 
 
1 Overview and Hazards 
 Process Isolations are part of BGC‚ÄôS Permit-To-Work (PTW) system and 
are controlled by an Isolation Confirmation Certificate (ICC) which shall be 
in place prior to start of work. The intent of an isolation and Lock \Out Tag 
out system is to minimize the risk to people, the environment and assets from exposure 
to energy (pressure, electrical, kinetic, temperature, etc) and hazardous substances 
during invasive maintenance, through effective isolation of equipment and the 
placement of locks and tags. For all types of isolations (e.g., electrical and mechanical / 
piping) systems / equipment being isolated must be tested to verify zero energy (test to 
verify dead) by both the person applying the initial locks / isolations and tags and theîhh	uhNhèî(hhhêhNubå$74cb2a96-d31b-42af-bcdc-85360aae9fefîh

verify dead) by both the person applying the initial locks / isolations and tags and the 
persons who will be carrying out the work on such equipment / systems.  
 
  
This WMP is not for: 
‚Ä¢ Portable equipment with flexible wiring and a plug under complete control of one 
person; 
‚Ä¢ Testing of energized electrical equipment or other electrical work. 
 Examples of energy or hazardous substances are: 
‚Ä¢ Gas or liquids under pressure; 
‚Ä¢ Flammable or toxic substances; 
‚Ä¢ Extreme hot or cold temperatures; 
‚Ä¢ Stored energy in equipment (e.g. under tension, locked in pressure); 
‚Ä¢ Mechanical energy from moving internal parts; 
‚Ä¢ Electricity; 
‚Ä¢ Kinetic energy from being struck by a moving object; 
‚Ä¢ Ionizing radiation.

2  Roles and Responsibilities  
2.1  The isolation and Reinstatement process have the following Authorized Person Roles: 
‚Ä¢ Isolation Owner (IO); 
‚Ä¢ Isolation Supervisor ((IS); 
‚Ä¢ Isolation Manager (IM). 
2.2  The IO will be the main focal point for isolations for BGC staff and contractors who 
execute activities as the Person In Charge of Work Site (PICWS).  
 
The responsibilities for an IO are: 
‚Ä¢ To define the scope of the isolation and undertake a risk assessment to determine 
the minimum level of isolation required, based on the Isolation Selector Tool; 
‚Ä¢ To develop an isolation and a de-isolation plan to provide the minimum level of 
isolation required or mitigates the risk to As Low as Reasonably Practicable (ALARP);  
‚Ä¢ To execute the authorized isolation as per the agreed isolation scheme, to apply 
locks and tags;îhh	uhNhèî(hhhêhNubå$de910af1-8986-43f6-acc6-e1de13f2b107îh

‚Ä¢ To execute the authorized isolation as per the agreed isolation scheme, to apply 
locks and tags; 
‚Ä¢ To monitor isolations that are live (in place), including checking pressure build up via 
local gauge; 
‚Ä¢ To de-isolate the equipment when authorized to do so by the IS. 
  
3  Requirements 
3.1  In BGC the Safe Isolation 8 Step Process is applied and is shown in Figure 1. 
3.2  The only exemption from this process is the personal isolation.  
The personal isolation can be defined as an isolation conducted under the exclusive 
management of the person servicing or maintaining the equipment and it does not add 
value to plan and manage the isolation under a full isolation certificate.  
A personal isolation can only be applied if the following conditions are met: 
‚Ä¢ Simple routine activities i.e. a glycol filter change out, for which approved operating 
procedures are available;îhh	uhNhèî(hhhêhNubå$236a70f5-33ff-4bf9-9e51-1cfa16ead196îh

‚Ä¢ Simple routine activities i.e. a glycol filter change out, for which approved operating 
procedures are available; 
‚Ä¢ Isolation and Work conducted by one individual during one shift; 
‚Ä¢ An effective zero energy check is conducted; 
‚Ä¢ PICWS is competent to carry out the isolation and permitted work; 
‚Ä¢ Work site is not left unattended; 
‚Ä¢ The servicing or maintenance does not create a hazard for other people; 
‚Ä¢ For electrical isolations, a personal isolation can only be carried out on Low Voltage 
(LV) equipment. No High Voltage personal isolations are permitted. 
3.3  BGC Safe Isolation 8 Step Process 
If the above requirements are not met an isolation will be applied according to the Safe 
Isolation Process: 
‚Ä¢ Step 6: Maintain Isolation is the key step which is relevant for the PICWS. 
‚Ä¢ In this process step the different roles have the following Process Step 
Responsibilities as described below:îhh	uhNhèî(hhhêhNubå$4243e92e-4e1d-46bb-a26d-d5d87cad9997îh

safety. In BGC there are different types of L&H Equipment that are used at the 
facilities and locations. This WMP covers all L&H activities from construction, maintenance 
and operations.  
1.2 L&H operations are one of the major causes of fatalities and serious incidents across the oil 
and gas industry.  
Hazards include: 
 ‚Ä¢ Loads crushing due to impact of moving objects or loads falling from vehicles; 
‚Ä¢ Contact with overhead electrical cables; 
‚Ä¢ Lifting over live equipment; 
‚Ä¢ Moving vehicles or collapsing structures, i.e. cranes falling; 
‚Ä¢ Trapping/crushing while working at height, falling from height; 
‚Ä¢ Limbs or bodies caught in machinery or where personnel come between the movingîhh	uhNhèî(hhhêhNubå$f2d20b23-f666-41a2-9dc8-cc5caf44731bîh

Work Management Procedure 
#22 Management of Change (MOC) 
 
1 Overview and Hazards 
1.1 This WMP describes the MOC process as applied in BGC Operating Asset. MOC is the 
process to manage risks introduced by changes. A change refers to a planned action or 
intervention that modifies the function of any item or process on a temporary or 
permanent basis. MOC processes for other activities (e.g. Projects, Document 
Management, Organisational Changes, etc.) will be controlled separately from this 
WMP. 
 
The purpose of this WMP is to provide all BGC staff and contractor employees with 
information on how to mitigate risks that may result from a change and ensure:  
‚Ä¢ All risks introduced by changes are identified  
‚Ä¢ The required mitigations are defined and implemented 
‚Ä¢ The residual risk is assessed and acceptedîhh	uhNhèî(hhhêhNubå$dbb184ac-c87d-4d09-afe7-0c2632e5521fîh

  h}î(hhhKêuhX"  ‚Ä¢ All risks introduced by changes are identified  
‚Ä¢ The required mitigations are defined and implemented 
‚Ä¢ The residual risk is assessed and accepted 
‚Ä¢ Secondary changes (such as Document updates, trainings, other changes required 
 to  systems as Corporate Maintenance Management System (CMMS) are identified 
 and implemented 
Every MOC should comply to the DEM2 and relevant industrial best practices. Before 
energizing and/or introducing hydrocarbons to any modification, the appropriate 
authorization should be given. Depending on the extend of the change this may be with 
‚Äú5 question before authorisation‚Äù or a Prestart-up Safety Review/Statement of Fitness 
(PSSR/SoF).  The boundaries between the P&E and asset MOC processes are shown in 
Figure 1 below:

1.2 Hazards of not correctly applying MOC 
 Inappropriate or ineffective MOC 
can lead to significant incidents, 
including; 
1. Hydrocarbon releases; 
2. Fires; 
3. Explosions;  
4. Electrocution; 
5. Failure of safety-critical 
systems. 
Lack of effective MoC has been a major 
contribution to escalation of incidents in the 
industry such as: 
1. Bhopal (1984) ‚Äì Operationally out of services 
 (safety) systems; 
2. Chernobyl (1986) ‚Äì Unauthorized change of test 
 run / operating procedures; 
3. Piper alpha (1988) ‚Äì Fireproof refugees impacted 
 after changes; 
4. Texas City (2005) - Overfill scenario and impact on 
 isolations missed after change.

variations are done in a controlled way. 
‚Ä¢ The authorizer confirms the readiness review has been successful and that energy (in 
the form of pressure/flow/temperature/electricity) and/or hydrocarbons can be 
introduced. To do this he/she should be able to answer at least the following five 
questions or follow PSSR/Statement of Fitness (SOF) depending on the extent of the 
change as defined in OMP.  
 
1. Was the change implemented in the field in accordance with all design details? 
2. Are all affected procedures updated and in place?îhh	uhNhèî(hhhêhNubå$87ea8d8d-ff2a-4e07-9f6c-b882af9735f7îh

4. Have all recommendations from the risk analysis, necessary for startup (where 
applicable), been completed? 
5. Has the documentation (including redlined drawings) required by the recipient of 
the change been updated and made available to the user?

or a permanent change carried out before the temporary change can be closed out. 
Look back When thought necessary, the MOC panel can select MOCs for a retrospective review (post 
implementation review) to verify whether the change delivered what was intended. This is 
likely to only apply to large scale changes. Learnings captured from this review will be used 
as input for the overall performance review of the MOC system. 
2.7  Additional Types of MOCs 
 Temporary Changes 
‚Ä¢ Changes which will eventually be removed, are called temporary changes. Temporary 
changes will follow the same process as permanent changes. They have a planned removal 
date and require a new review and approval if installation exceeds the planned removal date.îhh	uhNhèî(hhhêhNubå$a2b9f955-8519-4a2b-8b37-6b8c60df6410îh

date and require a new review and approval if installation exceeds the planned removal date. 
‚Ä¢ In case a temporary MOC is requested, the requestor should indicate how the temporary 
nature of the change can be eliminated with a normalization plan. The normalization plan is 
one of the two following: 
o Return to normal; 
o Extend as permanent with additional requirements. 
‚Ä¢ The MOC should confirm if there are any operating limitations or not. Mitigations to a 
temporary situation may include an operating instruction, additional inspection intervals and 
others. 
‚Ä¢ Temporary changes are not expected to be valid for more than 12 months. Temporary 
changes may be extended once by the same reviewers and approver(s). Second and 
following extensions require approval from the Asset Services Director.

‚Ä¢ Temporary MOC request Owners shall be tracking their requests, and if there is 
a requirement to extend an MOC, they shall do it timely at least two weeks 
before the original expiry date. An overdue MOC is a Process Safety 
Fundamental (PSF) violation. 
‚Ä¢ A MOC may be required for Overrides, for details please refer to WMP #28 Safety System 
Isolation and Override Control.  
‚Ä¢ Temporary changes include: 
o Temporary equipment; 
o Occupied temporary portable facilities. PSBR1 assessment by Technical Safety 
Engineering (TSE) TA shall be completed as part of MOC supporting documents; 
o Temporary repairs.

 Emergency Change (exceptional circumstances only) 
‚Ä¢ In the circumstance where the time constraint is such that the MOC process cannot be 
followed in full as there is an immediate danger to life or health or a condition that may 
result in severe impact to the environment or imminent equipment damage an emergency 
change may be requested. 
‚Ä¢ Emergency change must be approved by the Asset Services Director or on-call delegate. 
Approval will only be granted once a hazard analyses and risk assessment has been carried 
out. 
‚Ä¢ The Approver will determine the timeline for the emergency change without formal MOC 
approval. In case the emergency change exceeds 24 hours a formal extension will need to be 
requested. The extension may be granted by the Asset Services Director. An emergency 
change may be extended max. two times. 
‚Ä¢ A formal MOC must be initiated once the organization has retained control of the situation.îhh	uhNhèî(hhhêhNubå$a8f8a35e-498e-4483-8f4f-905d6a3385c5îh

Work Management Procedure 
#23 Manual Handling 
 
1. Overview and Hazards 
1.1 Manual handling includes lifting, lowering, pushing and pulling by human effort. All BGC 
staff and contractors shall follow proper handling techniques to avoid back and hand 
injuries. Back injuries can be prevented by correct manual lifting techniques.  
 
1.2 Hazards include: 
‚Ä¢ Strained muscles and torn ligaments can occur while attempting to lift, pull or push a 
load beyond your physical capabilities; 
‚Ä¢ Hernia and slipped discs can occur by attempting to lift a load exceeding your own 
physical capabilities or by falling or slipping during the lifting or carrying operation. 
 
2.  Plan the Work 
2.1  Follow the Hierarchy of Controls for manual handling: 
Eliminate: Can we redesign the task or activity so that items don‚Äôt need to be moved or 
handled?îhh	uhNhèî(hhhêhNubå$02628217-6985-45a5-8c50-0666aef677ebîh

  h}î(hhhKöuhX√  2.  Plan the Work 
2.1  Follow the Hierarchy of Controls for manual handling: 
Eliminate: Can we redesign the task or activity so that items don‚Äôt need to be moved or 
handled?  
Substitute: Can we use different materials that are lighter and easier to handle?  Can we 
split the load into smaller, easier managed items? 
Engineer: Can we use mechanical aids or lifting devices to handle the load?  
E.g. trolley or lifting jib, cart, strops (ropes) and ergonomics. 
Communication: Supervision, within a work crew, verification of fitness to work. 
Avoid manual handling when there are other methods available.  
2.2  Where manual handling is still required, team leaders shall ensure, where reasonably 
practicable, appropriate equipment for lifting, lowering, pushing, pulling, carrying, 
handling or transporting heavy or awkward loads is provided to team members. 
2.3  Before any manual Handling of a load that could injure a person, he/she shall perform aîhh	uhNhèî(hhhêhNubå$a298c920-f26e-45e4-90e4-9e78b602af17îh

  h}î(hhhKöuhX  handling or transporting heavy or awkward loads is provided to team members. 
2.3  Before any manual Handling of a load that could injure a person, he/she shall perform a 
hazard assessment that considers the: 
‚Ä¢ Weight and size of the load; 
‚Ä¢ Shape of the load; 
‚Ä¢ Type of grips on the load (coupling); 
‚Ä¢ Number of times the load shall be moved; 
‚Ä¢ Route that shall be taken to move the load; 
‚Ä¢ Physical strength and capacity of the individual, including any physical limitations or 
medical conditions. 
2.4  Do not manually lift a weight that is more than 20kg, female limit 16kg.  
The maximum weight limit shall be adjusted depending on how the load is being lifted, 
how close to the body it is held, work crew size, and how high or how low the weights are 
to be lifted.îhh	uhNhèî(hhhêhNubå$aec3295f-8cab-440e-a9c2-84ce292fef08îh

3  Do The Work 
3.1  ‚Ä¢ Best practices for body positioning for manual handling are as follows; 
‚Ä¢ Feet: close to the 
load, slightly 
apart, lead foot 
slightly forward; 
‚Ä¢ Feet: in line with 
the hips to keep 
good balance; 
‚Ä¢ Knees: bend 
ready to lift by 
straightening but 
do not squat;  
‚Ä¢ Back: straight and 
rigid at all times. 
Shall not be more 
than 15 degrees 
from the vertical; 
‚Ä¢ Buttocks: push your buttocks as far back as possible. This helps your position; 
 ‚Ä¢ Arms: keep the load close to your body. Do not reach out with fully extended arms. 
Keeping the load close reduces strain and tiredness; 
‚Ä¢ Correct Grip: firmly with palms and fingers. Balance by moving your back leg as you lift 
the load. Use handles when available; 
 ‚Ä¢ Hands: always use the BGC default gloves, see WMP #26 PPE; 
‚Ä¢ Head and Chin: head raised; chin tucked in.îhh	uhNhèî(hhhêhNubå$f415664e-b77e-4d21-8db9-250c35ca52b7îh

 ‚Ä¢ Hands: always use the BGC default gloves, see WMP #26 PPE; 
‚Ä¢ Head and Chin: head raised; chin tucked in. 
3.2  Supervisors shall ensure team members involved in manual handling understand the risks 
involved and are able to demonstrate the correct manual lifting techniques. 
3.3  Do not start to manually lift a load before: 
‚Ä¢ The area is free from obstructions; 
‚Ä¢ You have done a quick weight test;  
‚Ä¢ You have found the load‚Äôs center of gravity. 
If the object to be handled is too heavy or awkward, get help. The manual lifting method 
for two or more people is the same as for one person. 
Consider similar height during manual lifting where two or more people are involved in 
carrying the heavy object. 
If the load is too heavy or difficult to lift manually, team members shall report to the team 
leader who shall provide appropriate equipment.  
3.4  Injury Prevention Controls  
‚Ä¢ Reduce distances to the loads to be handled;îhh	uhNhèî(hhhêhNubå$cc5696e8-5320-43c9-9db9-188290d227adîh

‚Ä¢ Reduce distances to the loads to be handled; 
‚Ä¢ Provide the proper manual handling devices such as carts and dollies; 
‚Ä¢ Arrange to have smaller, lighter, and easier to handle load sizes; 
‚Ä¢ Suspend heavy tools from balancers to reduce the force required to hold the tool; 
‚Ä¢ Avoid standing with a heavy load; if you stop, set it down by reversing the manual 
lifting techniques;îhh	uhNhèî(hhhêhNubå$80521ccf-7b4c-4e11-8c8e-7fe421db213aîh

‚Ä¢ Do not carry a load which obstructs your view and always ensure that your line of 
travel is clear from obstructions; 
‚Ä¢ Never attempt to change your grip while carrying a load. If a change is necessary, set 
the load down on a firm support, change your grip and lift the load up again; 
‚Ä¢ Always consider the physical limitations of the individual, including age, gender, 
medical conditions, physical fitness.

‚Ä¢ Check the forklift with the pre-use checklist in Appendix 1. 
‚Ä¢ When driving, give way to pedestrians. Be aware of surroundings when reversing. 
‚Ä¢ Observe speed limits and ensure the forklift can make a safe stop at any time.  
‚Ä¢ Avoid harsh accelerating, harsh braking or harsh turning.  
‚Ä¢ Use a Flagman to guide where visibility is blocked. Watch out for overhead 
obstructions. 
‚Ä¢ Ensure that loads are within the rated load capacity of the forklift.  
‚Ä¢ Movement with loads in excessively raised positions should not be carried out to 
avoid the danger of toppling, especially on uneven surfaces and while cornering.îhh	uhNhèî(hhhêhNubå$20d20aaf-b95e-40ee-bd3a-6009b6458a69îh

  h}î(hhhK†uhXÛ  ‚Ä¢ Movement with loads in excessively raised positions should not be carried out to 
avoid the danger of toppling, especially on uneven surfaces and while cornering. 
‚Ä¢ Forklifts should only be used for loads, which can be carried safely on the forks or 
attachments fitted. Non-standard, unpackaged and excessively wide loads should be 
avoided wherever possible. Long tubes should be carried using appropriate 
attachments. 
‚Ä¢ They are not to be operated on excessive gradients or across gradients.  
‚Ä¢ In general, they should be driven forwards up a 
slope, backwards down a slope and in line with the 
incline.  It may be necessary to raise the forks 
slightly at the bottom of a slope to avoid grounding.  
‚Ä¢ Operate the forklift with the load placed fully 
against the load back rest.  
‚Ä¢ Forklift shall not be used to raise a person. Don‚Äôt 
transport a person not in a suitable seat with 
seatbelt.

lowered to the ground. 
3.17  Additional Requirements for Rough Terrain Forklift Trucks 
‚Ä¢ Care should always be taken to ensure that traction is retained.  
‚Ä¢ Loss of traction due to the nature of the terrain or weight transfer taking load off the 
driving wheels is to be avoided. 
‚Ä¢ Care should be taken, and speeds minimized to reduce the risk of load toppling 
caused by the imbalance induced when operating on rough terrainîhh	uhNhèî(hhhêhNubå$889569e9-f4f9-4019-984c-857f6a6f5aa7îh

Work Management Procedure 
#25 Permit To Work (PTW) 
 
1 Overview and Hazards  
1.1 BGC‚Äôs PTW is a formal documented system that manages specific work within 
BGC‚Äôs locations and activities. PTW aims to ensure Hazards and Risks are 
identified, and Controls are in place to prevent harm to People, Assets, Community, and 
the Environment (PACE). The PTW process: 
‚Ä¢ Requires proper planning and consideration of activities before permission is given to 
start work;   
‚Ä¢ Authorizes certain people to carry out specific work at a specific time and place; 
‚Ä¢ Sets out the precautions required to complete the work safely.   
1.2 An issued PTW does not mean all risks are controlled or that work is safe to proceed.  
Workers must read, understand, and follow the precautions in the PTW documents 
pack, while continuously assessing and managing risk. BGC Management expects fullîhh	uhNhèî(hhhêhNubå$97804f0e-518a-43b8-88bd-d8175b3de40cîh

2.2  The BGC PTW system applies to all activities within BGC process areas (brownfield) and 
150 m either side of a buried or above ground asset. 
2.3  Pipeline Permits: 
‚Ä¢ For both intrusive and non-intrusive work on a pipeline, traps and associated piping 
inside the facilities fence boundaries the PTW will be issued/managed by the 
respective facility PTW office. A few examples of intrusive and non-intrusive work: 
o Intrusive activities are pigging & ILI inspection, valve operation (and stroking), pig 
trap door/end closure seal replacement, pipeline cut/replacement.  
o Non-intrusive work is inspection, coating removal, coating application, civil 
activities.

activities.  
‚Ä¢ For non-intrusive work on a pipeline or associated accessories (including pig trap and 
block valve stations) outside the facilities fence boundaries of 150 m the PTW will be 
issued/managed by the Pipeline team. Activities which involves welding onto a live 
pipeline (e.g. repair sleeves), the PTW will be issued/managed by the Pipeline team 
and co-signed by the relevant facilities PTW office.  The relevant facility shall ensure 
the required pressure control measures are correctly implemented and managed. 
2.4  For non-process areas, site- or activity-specific PTW systems can be developed and 
deployed, subject to approval by the BGC Director responsible for the site or activity. 
Examples Include:

Work Management Procedure 
#26 Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) 
  
1 Overview and Hazards 
1.1 PPE is equipment worn to reduce severity of injuries resulting from exposure to hazards 
in the workplace. 
1.2 Hazards 
Hazards in the workplace include among others chemical, radiological, physical, 
electrical, mechanical hazards as per WMP #13 Hazard identification. PPE is the least 
effective control in the Hierarchy of Controls   after hazard elimination, substitution, 
engineering and administrative controls.  
Hence PPE alone should not be relied upon to mitigate risk. 
 Relevant Life Saving Rules and Process Safety Fundamentals

  h}î(hhhK≥uhXÔ  2  Plan the Work 
2.1  All BGC staff and contractors must use the correct PPE as required for the job. Before any 
task Team Leaders and Supervisors are responsible for: 
‚Ä¢ Ensuring the requirements for PPE are identified and adequate, including proper 
maintenance and cleanliness of the equipment; 
‚Ä¢ The supply, issue and correct use of PPE;  
‚Ä¢ Ensuring people who use the PPE are fitted and trained/briefed to use it properly. 
This includes: 
o How to put on the PPE properly; 
o Specific fitness to work requirements for using the PPE (e.g. Respiratory Personal 
Protection - RPE); 
o Use of disposable PPE including the disposal of those contaminated PPE . 
2.2  Mandatory PPE on BGC sites is: 
‚Ä¢ Hard hat; 
‚Ä¢ Safety-toed shoes; 
‚Ä¢ Safety glasses; 
‚Ä¢ Gloves; 
‚Ä¢ Hearing protection (ear plugs and/or ear covers); 
‚Ä¢ Flame retardant coveralls;

2.3  Additional requirements for PPE are based on a risk 
assessment, depending on the site conditions and the 
scope and activities of the work.  
Where job conditions change, PPE selection must be 
reviewed to ensure it is still valid. See WMP #13 Hazard 
Identification. 
2.4  When specialised PPE is required (e.g. high noise, radiation, chemical storage areas, 
hydrocarbon process areas) it should be marked with prominent signage, universal 
symbols and/or in the language of the workforce to ensure that personnel are aware of 
the requirements. See also relevant WMPs specific to tasks and Hazards;  
 
2.5  Personal items with the potential to act as an ignition source are restricted from 
hydrocarbon process areas. See also WMP #13 Hazard Identification.

Work Management Procedure 
#27 Safety Signs & Barricades 
 
1 Overview and Hazards  
1.1 The purpose of this WMP is to describe the installation and maintenance of barricades, 
flagging and warning signs. 
1.2 A barricade is defined as a system designed to warn of a hazard and physically identify 
the Hazard‚Äôs parameters. Barricades (also referred to as barriers) can be ‚Äúsoft‚Äù or ‚Äúhard‚Äù, 
depending on the intended use and the nature of the hazard being protected. 
This WMP outlines the requirements for soft barricades, hard barricades, as well as 
signage which must be used in conjunction with barricades.   
All BGC staff and contractors shall be aware of the types of barricades used within the 
BGC assets and are responsible for respecting the barricades as well as following the 
conditions set within this procedure.îhh	uhNhèî(hhhêhNubå$2e02f357-d92f-43e8-8c8e-10277f1d232bîh

2.1  Follow WMP #13 Hazard Identification to identify the Hazards of the task and the 
location. Apply the Hierarchy of Controls to ensure that the most appropriate signs, 
barricades and controls have been selected. 
2.2  Confirm what approvals, documentation, Permit-To-Work (PTW), Job Hazard 
Analysis (JHA), ToolBox Talk (TBT), etc, is needed and who will check it is done 
before the work starts. Follow WMP #25 PTW.

Work Management Procedure 
#28 Safety System Isolation & Override Control 
 
1 Overview and Hazards 
1.1 BGC depends on an operating safeguarding system to ensure the safe operation and 
maintenance of assets. Sometimes, during maintenance, functional tests, 
equipment calibrations, and process start-up and stabilization activities, it is 
required to override a part of the safeguarding system. 
1.2 Before requesting for an override, it is very important to understand that 
overrides are only permitted when the production process is being operated 
within the design envelope. Safety Critical Equipment shall NOT be overridden 
to resolve upset conditions (trips or automated shutdowns). In this case, use stabilize, 
slow down, shutdown steps as needed. 
Relevant Life Saving Rules and Process Safety Fundamentalsîhh	uhNhèî(hhhêhNubå$ce4cd2c7-486a-41e0-a8a7-bdee4ebc57a9îh

1.3 
 
At all times, BGC process safeguarding systems, fire & gas systems and equipment shall 
only be overridden, isolated or inhibited by authorized BGC personnel once 
authorization is obtained and the activity will be executed with an approved 
Permit-To-Work (PTW).  
1.4 The contractor‚Äôs safeguarding systems on equipment (i.e. portable air compressor, diesel 
generator, chainsaw, grass cutter, etc.) used on a BGC operated facility and 
infrastructure shall only be overridden / isolated with authorization from the BGC Permit 
Authorizer. If a safety system is isolated or an override is installed and you are part ofîhh	uhNhèî(hhhêhNubå$55f9043e-98fe-4010-9bf1-2977b02e482aîh

Authorizer. If a safety system is isolated or an override is installed and you are part of 
the process, the following questions should be answered during the risk assessment: 
 ‚Ä¢ What device is/will be unavailable? 
‚Ä¢ What hazard is the device protecting against? 
‚Ä¢ What is the reason/driver for the override? 
‚Ä¢ Are there any other impaired barriers in the system? Can these be restored prior to 
the imposition of the override? 
‚Ä¢ What alternative layers of protection/ barriers will be relied on as mitigation 
including other permanent or temporary devices, existing or temporary procedures, 
authority, competence, oversight, interventions/ practices? 
‚Ä¢ What checks are required to ensure that there has been no degradation of plant and 
that the condition is as expected (i.e. mitigation plan)?

#29 Temporary Flexible Hose Assemblies 
 
1 Overview and Hazards 
1.1 This WMP is applicable for the use of 
temporary flexible hose assemblies. Hoses 
are considered as temporary when they 
are not a fixed part of the process 
equipment or portable equipment. 
Examples of temporary hoses are: Spray 
painting hose, connection of air-powered 
tools and equipment, compressed gas 
cylinder hoses for supplementing 
construction use e.g. purging activity, utility hose to drain a vessel, chemical injection 
hose, instrument air hose, etc.  
The following are not considered to be temporary hoses: Choke and kill hoses, bunkering

Work Management Procedure 
#30 Waste Management 
 
1 Overview and Hazards 
1.1  BGC will manage waste from its operation using a risk-based approach, demonstrating 
compliance, control, and a sustainable waste treatment solution.  
 
Waste: Any substance or object which the holder intends or is required to throw away. 
Even if the substance or article is given to someone else to be reused or recycled, it is 
still legally considered to be waste if it is no longer required by the person who produced 
it. 
2.1  Hazards of not following this WMP include: 
‚Ä¢ Environmental harm; 
‚Ä¢ Potential ill-health effects to people; 
‚Ä¢ Reputational damage to BGC; 
‚Ä¢ Enforcement action by local or state authorities.

Work Management Procedure 
#31 Work at Height (WAH) 
 
1 Overview and Hazards 
1.1 WAH is any activity where there is a risk of injury from falling or Dropped Objects 
where this a fall distance of 1.8 meters (6 feet) or more from any working level.  
This WMP describes the requirements to prevent injuries from falls or dropped objects 
when accessing or working at height.  
Work or access outside an approved fixed work platform equipped with fixed guard rails 
requires a WAH certificate and additional specific controls and equipment.  
This WMP covers the requirements prior to, during and after the completion of any work 
involving access and working at heights on fixed structures, scaffolds, Mobile Elevated 
Work Platforms (MEWP), ladders, delta decks or mobile and access towers.

3  Do The Work 
3.1  Personal Fall Arrest 
A fall arrest system minimally 
includes (A-B-C); Anchorage, 
Body support and Connecting 
device. The anchorage is 
normally a stable point where a 
connecting device is attached 
with the other end attaching to a 
lanyard and harness.  
      Figure 3 Personal Arrest System  
3.2  Before use, workers must visually inspect fall protection equipment. Any deficiency 
found means works must be paused and the supervisor shall be informed, see checklist 
Appendix 1.  
3.3  Fall protection equipment must be used only for worker protection and must not be 
used for the movement of materials. 
3.4  Except for during erecting and dismantling scaffolds, anchorage points used for 
attachment of fall protection components shall be independent of any anchorage being 
used to support or suspend platforms and capable of supporting at least 2,268Kg perîhh	uhNhèî(hhhêhNubå$a36dda5f-1489-458b-bc9a-57c7d527ecbeîh

used to support or suspend platforms and capable of supporting at least 2,268Kg per 
person attached to it.   
3.5  Anchor points shall not be used to anchor multiple lifelines. 
3.6  Working alone while using a personal fall arrest system shall not be permitted. 
3.7  Personal fall arrest systems shall not be attached to a guardrail system (e.g. gantry 
handrails) or to a hoist not designed for personnel lifts. 
3.8  Fall arrest devices (inertia reels etc.) shall be placed directly above the worker to prevent 
pendulum falls. The maximum recommended deviation of the wire from the vertical is 
30 deg. This means that the worker should always be working in a 60-deg. cone. 
3.9  Lanyards, vertical lifelines, and body harnesses shall meet standards as per WMP #26 
PPE. Except for working from MEWP, only shock absorbing lanyards shall be used.  Forîhh	uhNhèî(hhhêhNubå$e3956fd5-52d3-4937-a869-c8abfeca794eîh

PPE. Except for working from MEWP, only shock absorbing lanyards shall be used.  For 
work from MEWP, restraining harness shall be used and are mandatory immediately on 
entering the work basket. 
3.10  Personal fall arrest systems and components subjected to a significant fall or full load 
shall be immediately removed from service and not used again until the equipment has 
been inspected and determined to be undamaged and suitable for reuse. However, 
lanyards subjected to a fall or load shall be immediately discarded and cut in two to 
prevent re-use. 
3.11  Ropes and straps used in lanyards, lifelines, and strength components of body harnesses 
shall be made from synthetic fibers or wire rope. 
3.12  Tie-off practices shall follow equipment design and manufacturer recommendations. 
3.13  Tie-offs using a knot in a lanyard or lifeline shall not be used. Tie-offs where the lineîhh	uhNhèî(hhhêhNubå$38bbe50c-455f-4687-a34b-be88d60fcf9eîh

3.14  When it is impractical to use a lanyard, a rope grab system can be used on a vertical 
lifeline. 
3.15  When vertical lifelines are used, each worker shall be attached to a separate lifeline. 
3.16  Horizontal lifelines shall be designed, installed, and used, under the supervision of the 
Area Engineer as part of a complete fall arrest system. 
3.17  Dee-rings and snap hooks shall have a minimum tensile strength of at least 2,268 kg 
(5,000 pounds). They shall be purchased with certification showing proof-test to a 
minimum tensile load of 1,633 kg (3,600 pounds) without cracking, breaking or taking 
permanent deformation. 
3.18  Non-locking type snap-hooks are prohibited. Snap hooks must be connected to suitable 
hardware and never be connected to another snap hook. Connectors shall have aîhh	uhNhèî(hhhêhNubå$c2beb7a9-bca9-4407-943a-1b30e14b4729îh

corrosion resistant finish and all surfaces and edges should be smooth.  Figure 4, below, 
shows examples of INCORRECT connections. 
Figure 4: Incorrect Connections 
3.19  Free Fall Distance & Swing Falls 
Personal fall arrest systems must be selected and rigged to ensure that potential free fall 
distances will never exceed 1.8m.  
‚Ä¢ Total fall distance is the sum of free fall distance and deceleration distance; 
‚Ä¢ Dynamic elongation of the system (temporary elastic stretch of connecting 
components and subsystems) and the worker‚Äôs height must be added to total fall 
distance and the user must allow for clearance;îhh	uhNhèî(hhhêhNubå$819f55c1-911f-4a45-8c97-039581eb3b61îh

‚Ä¢ It is prudent to allow for an additional safety factor of 1m below the fallen worker‚Äôs 
feet. 
Figure 5 Free Fall Distance & Swing Falls 
 
3.20  Swing falls can occur when the system is 
not anchored directly above the user.  
The force of striking an object in a pendular 
motion can cause serious injury.  
Always minimize swingfalls by working as 
directly below the anchorage point as 
possible.

‚Ä¢ Ladders must extend a minimum of 1050mm above the working platform.  
Any opening (other than access points) shall be enclosed by means of guardrails / 
toe-boards to stop any potential risk of a fall or dropped objects;  
‚Ä¢ Where reasonably practicable ladders must be enclosed by means of double 
guardrails at the top of the access point that provides additional edge protection;  
‚Ä¢ The intermediate guardrail and toe board must be omitted on the inboard side 
adjacent to the ladder to permit clear access to the working platform. Swing gates 
are the preferred method of gaining access and egress from ladders;  
‚Ä¢ The access and egress point must not have a solid tube running through it;îhh	uhNhèî(hhhêhNubå$c622be4e-d49f-4407-9bf8-40112022d622îh

1 Overview and Hazards 
1.1 This WMP defines requirements for safely working near or transiting underneath overhead 
lines defined as overhead line encroachment.  An overhead line encroachment‚ÄØis any activity 
that intrudes, or has the potential to intrude, within the safe clearance distances of Overhead 
Lines.‚ÄØThe Minimum Approach Distance (MAD) means the distance between high voltage lines 
or equipment and work being performed by non-qualified BGC staff or contractors.  
 
This WMP includes requirements for: 
‚Ä¢ Encroachment zone authorization and planning; 
‚Ä¢ Minimum approach distance; 
‚Ä¢ (Vehicle) Transit underneath or near lines; 
‚Ä¢ Precautions when working near overhead lines;

Figure 6: Transit Clearance of Overhead Lines 
‚Ä¢ If the Transit Clearance cannot be met and the transit is necessary, then the lines 
should be de-energized and earthed. Contact the Senior Electrical Authority (SEA) 
and Road Safety team to discuss the plan. 
3.6  Controls 
‚Ä¢ Lower the boom of the lifting equipment into its rest position and secure safely in 
place when transiting underneath or near overhead lines. 
‚Ä¢ Use spotters wearing high visibility garments.

‚Ä¢ Wait for confirmation by the line operator that the overhead line 
is completely de-energized (voltage-free) and confirm with 
support from Responsible Person Electrical and team (prove & 
verify with voltage tester) 
‚Ä¢ If vehicle still functioning (excluding Cranes in setup position) 
follow the guidelines as illustrated in figure 7 ‚ÄòWhat to do in a 
non-emergency in case of overhead lines contact‚Äô 
o If possible, drive away or turn away from the high-voltage line. 
o Do not leave the vehicle until sufficient distance (minimum 4 
meter) away from energized conductors.  Figure 7: Non-emergency in caseîhh	uhNhèî(hhhêhNubå$e94936a9-3818-4d93-a66d-de3e0da00767îh

to the operator follow the guidelines as illustrated in Figure 8 
‚ÄòWhat to do in an emergency in case of overhead lines contact‚Äô: 
o If the vehicle does not move due to damage and there is no 
immediate risk to the operator, the operator must remain in 
the vehicle.  
o There is no immediate danger to the operator while staying in 
the vehicle. 
o When stepping out, there is an acute risk of electrocution by 
bridging the full voltage difference between the vehicle and the 
earth / ground. 
‚Ä¢ If vehicle no longer functioning and there is immediate danger to 
the operator follow the guideline as illustrated in Figure 8 ‚ÄòWhat to

Note From BGC Managing Director  
Safety is good for Business and is at the core of everything we do in 
BGC.  
Our aim is to protect and safeguard our employees, contractors, the 
environment, our communities and BGC‚Äôs assets. It is therefore essential 
that we all know and comply with the BGC HSE requirements. We all 
have the responsibility to protect ourselves and others. 
The WMP is a manual that communicates our HSE requirements and 
best practices and focusses on what is really needed at the work front to 
keep people safe.  
This version 2 of the WMP captures learnings since the implementation of Version 1 and 
improvement & simplification feedback received from the Business from using the WMP in 
the field over the last year. 
Scope of the WMP 
‚Ä¢ The WMP captures key activities completed by frontline BGC staff and contractors.îhh	uhNhèî(hhhêhNubå$849b1e38-500a-4177-8068-06d1271232fcîh

Scope of the WMP 
‚Ä¢ The WMP captures key activities completed by frontline BGC staff and contractors. 
Activities conducted by specialized contractors only (e.g. Ionizing Radiation, Tank Cleaning, 
Asbestos Category 2) may have additional requirements. 
Implementation: Roles & Responsibilities 
‚Ä¢ All BGC and contractors are responsible for following the WMP requirements. If anyone 
sees these requirements not being followed, they must safely intervene. 
‚Ä¢ Line Managers (BGC and Contractors) are responsible for ensuring these requirements are 
available to workers and appropriate supervision and control is in place (including Permit-
To Work (PTW), where required) to check that the requirements are understood and 
implemented. 
‚Ä¢ Plant, Site and Facility Managers are responsible for confirming that works undertaken on 
their area of responsibility are confirmed as being in accordance with BGC WMPs.

their area of responsibility are confirmed as being in accordance with BGC WMPs. 
Training & Competencies 
‚Ä¢ A number of WMP sections define activity specific training and competence requirements 
(e.g. WMP #25 PTW) staff and contractors have to meet enabling them to conduct these 
activities safely. 
‚Ä¢ On top of these specific requirements as a minimum all BGC staff and contractors shall 
complete the ‚ÄòBGC HSE Corporate HSE Induction‚Äô supported by site specific HSE 
orientations

2.3  For Breaking Containment on a system which has already been spaded in close proximity, (less 
than 5m as a guide), to the work (for example removing an already spaded pump), then there 
is no requirement for a Breaking Containment permit, as containment has already been broken 
previously (along with DFPV) for inserting the spades. This should be highlighted in the special 
precautions section of the permit used and highlighted during the toolbox talk 
2.4  For breaking containment on systems containing non-hazardous materials (for example air or 
water) then there is no requirement for a Breaking Containment permit. However, a JHA 
should be considered to identify the hazards and controls, particularly in systems which have a 
pressure envelope, for example instrument air.

3.1  Before Starting the Work 
Ensure that there no conflicting Manual of Operatrions (MOPO) or Simultaneous Operations 
(SIMOPS) review is conducted in the PTW office, to ensure there are no conflicting activities in 
close proximity to where the breaking containment will take place. Some examples of conflicts 
could be : 
‚Ä¢ Hot Work 1 within 50m of the Breaking Containment (HC gas from the Breaking 
Containment could migrate to the HW site and cause a fire or explosion)

the crane and cause an explosion) 
Work at Height (WAH) in close proximity (gases from the Breaking Containment 
may impede the WAH party from escaping the area safely). 
3.2  The following steps shall be followed and are the responsibility of Operations: 
‚Ä¢ Execution of the isolation plan (OMP14) 
‚Ä¢ Execution of the Draining, Flaring, Purging, Venting (DVPF) plan (OMP18):

2.8  Hot Work with positive sources of ignition in a confined space is an additional hazard, 
see WMP #16 Hot Work. Before executing Hot Work in a confined space, workers 
must first check if alternative method is possible. If not: 
‚Ä¢ Follow Table 1, below; 
‚Ä¢ Verify no hydrocarbons are present in hidden pockets or gaps in the confined space; 
‚Ä¢ Ventilation plan and additional Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) should consider the 
risk such as (welding) fumes. 
2.9  Excavations deeper than 1.2m shall be defined as a confined space: 
‚Ä¢ Excavations in brownfield assets shall control the risk of hydrocarbon gas or toxic gas (e.g. 
H2S - see WMP #18 Hydrogen Sulphide (H2S)); 
‚Ä¢ For greenfield locations, if the dimensions of the excavation are twice (or more) as wide 
as deep they can be considered for exemption - see also WMP #7 Excavations.

2.10  Emergency Response 
An emergency rescue plan must be developed in partnership with Emergency Response Team 
(ERT) before entry is allowed into a confined space. The emergency plan must be clearly 
understood by workers. The plan must, as a minimum, detail the following: 
‚Ä¢ Cover all scenarios identified in JHA;  
‚Ä¢ Procedures for communicating emergencies; 
‚Ä¢ Identification of trained rescue personnel; 
‚Ä¢ Rescue equipment to be easily available when people are inside a confined space; 
‚Ä¢ Emergency escape routes; 
‚Ä¢ The designated emergency assembly area;

Confined Space. 
2.13  Ventilation Plan 
Develop Ventilation plan: 
‚Ä¢ For the given working environment and work activities, assess the ventilation 
requirements (natural and mechanical);  
‚Ä¢ Natural ventilation should be used where possible (open all possible hatches and 
openings); 
‚Ä¢ Mechanical ventilation can be used to provide cool clean air ‚Äì either Exhaust ventilation 
(sucks air out) or Forced air ventilation (blows air in).

Work Management Procedure 
#4 Driving Safety & Journey Management 
1. Overview and Hazards 
1.1 The purpose of this WMP is to ensure personnel involved in driving understand the 
potential hazards and apply controls to reduce incidents from driving and 
transportation.   
 
This WMP applies to all BGC arranged transport on road for BGC personnel, contractors and 
subcontractors who transport people and materials for BGC business. 
 
Use of private vehicles on company business is strictly prohibited. People traveling for business 
between sites should use company provided vehicles. Private vehicles should only be used for 
commuting and commuting is not scope of this WMP unless it is arranged by company provided 
vehicles.  
 
 
 
 
Commuting vs Business Travel 
Commuting is the journey from home to the designated BGC work location and the journeyîhh	uhNhèî(hhhêhNubå$a04797c7-fc76-47f9-b8dd-7d7e7430af22îh

consequences of an emergency and promote the return to normal and safe operations. 
Each BGC facility or site has its own ERP. Refer to the respective worksite ERP in case of 
incidents that require emergency response activation.   
 
This WMP section is only applicable to all non-ER BGC staff and contractors and covers 
generic ER procedures.  Requirements for ER staff are defined in the site ERPs and supporting 
ER documentation.

Work Management Procedure 
#6 Electrical Safety  
1. Overview and Hazards 
1.1 This WMP provides awareness and guidance how to  manage risks and hazards associated 
with electricity when operating and / or working on electrical systems. 
BGC has developed Electrical Safety Rules (ESR) and Electrical Safety Operating 
Procedures (ESOP) to manage the risks and hazards associated with electricity when 
operating and / or working on electrical systems. The ESR/ESOP mandates the minimum 
requirements to ensure safe work methods and practices are adopted for work across 
BGC‚Äôs electrical systems. The ESR/ESOP are applicable to any part of the electrical power 
generation and distribution system in the production and processing facilities, 
accommodations, and logistics bases across BGC (including temporary facilities andîhh	uhNhèî(hhhêhNubå$ce6cb7d4-4cdd-4aaf-9a92-29ed673dfae3îh

accommodations, and logistics bases across BGC (including temporary facilities and 
mobile / portable equipment). Within BGC the application of the ESR is mandatory and 
shall be always followed.  
1.2 Hazards 
 Electricity is a significant hazard. If work is not planned and done correctly this can lead to 
harm to people and environment and / or damage to equipment, facilities or buildings.  
‚Ä¢ Direct contact with electrical current can be deadly. While some electrical burns look 
minor, there still may be serious internal damage, especially to the heart, muscles, or 
brain. Electric current can cause injury in four ways: 
o Cardiac arrest due to the electrical effect on the heart 
o Muscle, nerve, and tissue destruction from a current passing through the body 
o Thermal burns from contact with the electrical source 
o Falling or injury after contact with electricityîhh	uhNhèî(hhhêhNubå$68c1bbbf-813e-4173-b54d-4550fc5ebb8fîh

}î(hjL  h}î(hhhKuhX∂  o Muscle, nerve, and tissue destruction from a current passing through the body 
o Thermal burns from contact with the electrical source 
o Falling or injury after contact with electricity 
‚Ä¢ Electricity operating at higher voltages can cause a spark to jump, initiating an arc flash 
without the need for physical contact. This can lead to the injuries as listed above and 
can also cause injuries to eyesight from the ‚Äòflash‚Äô associated with the arc. 
‚Ä¢ Overheating of equipment, fires or ignition of explosive atmospheres 
‚Ä¢ Some electrical systems are critical for the safe operation of equipment. If electrical 
systems are not correctly designed, installed, maintained, repaired, and protected from 
damage, the failure of that equipment can subsequently lead to harm or damage 
‚Ä¢ It is possible for stray electrical currents to be present, where equipment has not been 
properly designed, installed, maintained, repaired or damagedîhh	uhNhèî(hhhêhNubå$94ed023f-f6c1-48c8-99c8-bb3d078664bbîh

Appendix 4 Ground Penetration Radar (GPR)  
  
Purpose 
The purpose of this addendum is to demonstrate the advantages in using Ground 
Penetration Radar (GPR) with mechanical excavation to reduce traditional manual / 
hydrovac excavation. The tool shows a positive impact to HSE exposure, schedule, and 
cost. The development of the GPR technology has made it possible to detect UG 
obstacles using proper trained GPR operators and trials at BGC locations and other IOC 
companies in IRAQ show that with the high-level accuracy of GPR and the use of 100% 
hydrovac pilot trenching with manual excavation can be significantly reduced.  
Procedure 
The following steps explain the use of GPR: 
 
1- First step will be for the contractor personnel to mark out as per AFC drawings the 
proposed cable or pipe trench area. The area to be scanned will be increased with 1mîhh	uhNhèî(hhhêhNubå$369a4ff1-07a2-46e7-9389-6cc342c636a4îh

proposed cable or pipe trench area. The area to be scanned will be increased with 1m 
on both sides of the planned excavation area. (see figure 1). This will be done using 
white chalk marked on the ground, so the alignment/trench area is clearly visible. Any 
clashes with existing services or structures can be identified.

2- Second step will be once the alignment /route of the service ie cable/pipe is marked 
on the ground joint walkdown will be conducted with BGC and Contractor to verify 
and resolve any clashes if any. 
 
 
3- Third step will be that the contractors‚Äô personnel will carry out a site survey using 
Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) scan device to survey and identify if there are any 
underground services in area of the trench to be excavated as shown in Figure-2. The 
scan will go beyond the proposed area of excavation by 1m to give assurance and 
safeguard if any existing service are going towards the trench excavation.

4- Fourth step will be to contractor‚Äôs site surveyor to markup the findings using 
Geometric map for the proposed cable or pipe route as shown in Figure -3, indicating 
the location and depth of underground service/assets.îhh	uhNhèî(hhhêhNubå$22b398df-f166-4000-8a47-a26416521c01îh

5- If there are any underground services detected the contactor will mark the location of 
the services on the ground from the GPR survey report by using spray paint, fixing 
stakes or flags pins. This will assist the operators when hydrovac to take extra 
precautions when coming up the underground service 
 
 
6- Once the underground services have been marked on the ground the work crew will 
commence the Hydrovac works by completing shallow vertical trenches, 2 meter or 
less depth with 15 cm wide slots to expose the identified UG services. 
 
 
7- Manual and hydrovac excavation will be done to 1 m from the identified UG services 
and to the required depth. Upon underground services being exposed /visible, the 
BGC / Contractor will walkdown and inspect to review for the next stage of excavation 
which will be mechanical excavation (no services) or manual excavation.îhh	uhNhèî(hhhêhNubå$31c2fbcc-375c-4596-8ee7-e41c8ed30800îh

8- If no underground services are found with the GPR, mechanical excavation can 
commence, no hydrovac is needed. Mechanical excavation for the cleared area must 
be done with close monitoring from competent supervisor at the site. Mechanical 
excavation will no t be used within 2m of any live pipelines or within 1 metre 
horizontally of any utility until it is fully hand exposed.  
Note: traditional p ilot trenching is still captured in the excavation procedure under 6.1.2.

#10 Handling Asbestos 
 
1 Overview and Hazards 
1.1 This WMP describes the requirements for safe handling and disposal of Asbestos and 
Refractory Ceramic Fibers (RCF) Containing Materials A/RCF CM, during construction 
works and maintenance works.   
‚Ä¢ Asbestos is a naturally occurring fibrous silicate which is extracted from the earth by 
mining and then usually incorporated with other materials. It is used to form a large 
range of materials such as cement products, insulation materials, textiles, tiles, 
papers, fireproofing, building panels, brake linings, gaskets and many others. 
‚Ä¢ The introduction of new A/RCF CM is not permitted, use free A/RCF CM (i.e. glass 
wool and rock wool) instead. 
 
This WMP applies to Category A (Non-Licensable Work) only. Category B (Licensable 
Work) is outside scope of this WMP.

 Gasket  Cement  Textile 
1.2 Hazards include: 
 ‚Ä¢ Inhalation of asbestos fibers could lead to a debilitating lung disease and certain 
forms of lung cancer; 
‚Ä¢ The effect of asbestos exposure is cumulative i.e. the more exposure the higher the 
risk and consequence; 
‚Ä¢ Exposure to larger RCF material is associated with eye, skin and upper respiratory 
tract irritation; 
‚Ä¢ Inhalation of smaller very fine fibers has been linked to cancer.

3.7  All gas cylinders (full or empty) must be rigidly secured to a substantial structure at 2/3 
height. Only soldered link chains or belts with buckles are acceptable. Cylinder stands are 
also acceptable for a short period. 
Handcarts shall be used when moving gas cylinders. Cylinders must be chained to the 
carts. 
3.8  All cylinders must be fitted with safety valve covers before they are moved. 
3.9  Safe wheeled carts should be used to move cylinders. 
3.10  Always use a pressure-regulating device to control the flow of gas from the cylinder. 
3.11  The main cylinder valve shall be the only means by which gas flow is to be shut off.  
3.12  The correct position for the main valve is all the way on or all the way off. 
3.13  Close cylinder valves when not in use. Closing the valve isolates the cylinder‚Äôs contentsîhh	uhNhèî(hhhêhNubå$131f139a-1b90-420d-aeba-bc59050d201dîh

3.22  Cylinders must not be placed near heat or where they can become part of an electrical 
circuit. 
3.23  Cylinders must not be exposed to temperatures above 50o C (122 o F). In summer months 
where high ambient temperatures are experienced, store cylinders in shaded areas.  
Some rupture devices on cylinders will release at about 65 o C (149 o F). Some small 
cylinders are not fitted with rupture devices and may explode if exposed to high 
temperatures. 
3.24  Rapid release of a compressed gas must be avoided because it will cause an unsecured 
gas hose to whip dangerously, which also may build up enough static charge to ignite a 
flammable gas. 
3.25  Appropriate regulators must be used on each gas cylinder.

Work Management Procedure 
#13 Hazard Identification 
 
1 Overview and Hazards 
1.1 A Hazard is any situation, condition, material, substance or object that has the potential 
to cause harm to people, damage to assets, effect on the environment, impact to 
community, or damage BGC‚Äôs reputation. The purpose of this WMP is to ensure the right 
steps are followed to recognize hazards at worksites.  
Overarching hazards recognized in BGC operating assets are documented and managed 
through HSE Cases.  
‚Ä¢ HSE cases are developed, available at BGC operating sites and updated periodically; 
‚Ä¢ The HSE Case is a facility or operation-specific demonstration that the HSE risks from 
Major Hazards are managed to As Low As Reasonably Practicable (ALARP)and a 
description on how the HSE Management System is applied to manage HSE hazards;îhh	uhNhèî(hhhêhNubå$188d92de-4c27-4356-b1da-29c4def9554eîh

}î(hjç  h}î(hhhKIuhX’  Major Hazards are managed to As Low As Reasonably Practicable (ALARP)and a 
description on how the HSE Management System is applied to manage HSE hazards; 
‚Ä¢ Within the HSE Case several risks and hazards management tools are used, such as 
Hazards Identification (HAZID), Hazards Operability (HAZOP), Quantitative Risk 
Assessment (QRA), Health Risk Assessment (HRA) and Qualitative Risk Assessment. 
 
Activity specific tools such as Job Hazards Analysis (JHA), 7 STEPS and Worksite Hazards 
Management are used during day-to-day work in facilities.  
 
In BGC we apply a Hazard and Effects Management Process (HEMP)  following the below 
steps: 
‚Ä¢ Identification, risk assessment and control of Hazards; 
‚Ä¢ Evaluation and implementation of barriers (control and recovery measures); 
‚Ä¢ Documentation within HSE Cases that major HSE risks have been reduced to ALARP. 
 
 
1.2 HEMP tools are used in design and plant changes but also for the day-to-day worksite

Work Management Procedure 
#14 Health Management of Hydrocarbons in Air (BTEX) 
 
1 Overview and Hazards  
1.1 Benzene, Toluene, Ethyl Benzene and Xylene (BTEX) are aromatic hydrocarbon compounds 
that occur naturally in crude oil and gas. They are components of a wide range of Volatile 
Organic Compounds (VOCs) that are detectable by smell. 
BGC‚Äôs precautions follow industry standards, to limit exposure and ensure care for people‚Äôs 
health. Projects are underway in BGC to further limit exposure potential where required. 
1.2 Hazards 
 The component of highest concern is benzene due to its carcinogenic health risk.   
‚Ä¢ Consequently, Workplace Exposure Limit (WEL) and ambient air quality standards are set 
at very stringent concentrations. 
‚Ä¢ Monitoring VOC and BTEX concentrations show safe occupational levels across the vastîhh	uhNhèî(hhhêhNubå$888c6440-0a9f-4d74-b958-3c00c070b756îh

}î(hjË  h}î(hhhKPuhXö  at very stringent concentrations. 
‚Ä¢ Monitoring VOC and BTEX concentrations show safe occupational levels across the vast 
majority of BGCs operations and situations. Despite this some people may experience 
discomfort from VOC odour at particular times and conditions, and extra mitigation is 
needed in specific locations and conditions.  
‚Ä¢ People may feel short term discomfort (like headache, sore throat, sore eyes) if they 
remain directly downwind of venting odour for extended periods.

2  Plan The Work  
2.1  Follow WMP #13 Hazard Identification to identify the hazards of the task and the location and 
the potential for BTEX to be encountered. Apply the Hierarchy of Controls   to ensure that the 
most appropriate controls have been selected. 
2.2  Confirm what approvals, documentation, Permit-To-Work (PTW), Job Hazard Analysisîhh	uhNhèî(hhhêhNubå$b60da668-08c7-4bb6-bb50-986837dca15cîh

2.2  Confirm what approvals, documentation, Permit-To-Work (PTW), Job Hazard Analysis 
(JHA), ToolBox Talk (TBT), etc, is needed for the task and who will check it is done 
before the work starts. Follow WMP #25 PTW.  
2.3  The potential for exposure to hydrocarbons must be considered when planning any work at BGC 
facilities. Potential BTEX exposure exists wherever there are hydrocarbons, although the risk is 
elevated for work around particular sources identified through BGC, including: 
‚Ä¢ TEG units; 
‚Ä¢ Wastewater treatment pits at the NGL plants;  
‚Ä¢ Compressor lube and seal oil vents; 
‚Ä¢ Burn pits, and anywhere liquid hydrocarbons are released to ground;  
‚Ä¢ Excavations in any areas where contaminated soil or groundwater may be expected (e.g. 
burn pits, drains and process areas).

 Planning must consider   
2.4  Site instructions for the specific areas of concern (see Appendix 1) must be available and 
understood to ensure the right precautions are taken.   
2.5  Specific locations will require downwind precautions, site engagement and training in use of 
Respiratory Protection Equipment (RPE).  
2.6  Consider the type and duration of the task. 
2.7  Consult with your Line Manager to help minimize the need to enter or work in areas where the 
odours may occur (e.g. working downwind of a TEG vent plume should be designed out or 
avoided where possible). 
2.8  Contact Health Team for latest BTEX monitoring data and instructions if uncertain.  
2.9  RPE must be available for facilities and areas with known issues, and workers be provided with 
instructions for its use (e.g. fitting, adjustment and fit testing), see also WMP #26 PPE.îhh	uhNhèî(hhhêhNubå$7911b292-dbfb-432b-bb14-14888ee6819bîh

2.18  Precautions 
Personnel shall comply to the requirements stated in BGC Manuals Of Permitted Operations 
(MOPO). These are available at the PTW desks and the PTW Issuer ensures work 
permits are issued or revoked accordingly. 
The heat stress status of the environment is monitored between 1st May and the 
last day of September. Measurements are communicated to PTW desks and key personnel by 
HSE support personnel daily at 09:00, 13:00 and 15:00. 
Assessment of the heat stress status is done by measuring the ambient temperature (¬∞C) and 
the Relative Humidity (RH). The results are then inputted into the Heat Index Matrix to 
determine the Heat Index (in ¬∞C).

3  Do The Work 
3.1  Extreme Hot Weather 
Prevention of heat related illness is critical for all employees, contractors and sub-contractors, 
particularly during the summer months (when temperatures are commonly and above 40¬∞C 
and can be accompanied by high humidity levels).   
3.2  Failure to advise personnel of the dangers of heat stress, how to manage exposure and to 
implement this procedure could lead to injury, illness or even death. 
3.3  The body‚Äôs response to high heat exposure manifests in a range of conditions including rashes, 
cramps, heat stress, and the most severe, heat stroke (which is a medical emergency). In 
addition, dizziness or fainting as a result of heat exposure may result in more serious injury or 
incident if the individual affected may have been operating machinery, controlling an 
operation or working at height etc.  
An overview of Health Conditions, Symptoms and Treatment is given in Appendix 1.îhh	uhNhèî(hhhêhNubå$868b456e-5305-4c81-866d-c730d1197d10îh

An overview of Health Conditions, Symptoms and Treatment is given in Appendix 1. 
3.4  Workplace, Task Evaluation and Risk Assessment 
For most workplaces and tasks observation of the flag colour and implementing all the 
standard controls identified in this procedure provide adequate control of the heat stress risk 
associated with working in BGC‚Äôs facilities. Work with an elevated risk for heat 
stress shall be identified as part of preparing the PTW and associated documents.  
Some examples are:  
‚Ä¢ Confined Space Entry (CSE) or elevated work; 
‚Ä¢ Tasks that require the use of specific PPE such as respirators, facemasks, 
insulated clothing etc; 
‚Ä¢ Any job or task that requires strenuous physical activity; 
‚Ä¢ Work near radiant heat sources. 
 
If needed, preparation of this type of work can be supported by HSE personnel with the input 
from BGC Medical and Occupational Health Department.

Work Management Procedure 
#16 Hot Work 
 
1 Overview and Hazards 
1.1 Hot Work includes activities such as welding, cutting, heating, use of lighting 
towers and descaling as examples. The purpose of this WMP is to ensure 
personnel involved in Hot Work activities understand the potential hazards and 
apply controls to reduce the risks of incidents from fires and explosions.  
 
Non-hydrocarbon facilities in BGC like workshops and fabrication yards will be 
considered as non-hazardous areas as defined in this WMP. 
1.2 Hazards include: 
 ‚Ä¢ Increased risk of fire and/or explosion due to the presence of flammable products in 
large volumes and high pressures; 
‚Ä¢ Fire caused by heat, sparks, molten metal or direct contact with the flame; 
‚Ä¢ Explosion e.g. when cutting up or repairing tanks or drums which contain or may 
have contained flammable materials;îhh	uhNhèî(hhhêhNubå$8aa307b0-a181-4c1d-a27b-c83cdc2579acîh

2  Plan The Work  
2.1  Follow WMP #13 Hazard Identification to identify the Hazards of the task and the 
location. Apply the Hierarchy of Controls to ensure that the most appropriate controls 
have been selected. 
2.2  Hot Work activities must always be performed under a Permit-To-Work (PTW) 
unless the work is performed in a dedicated asset workshop or fabrication yard

2.5  When planning work activities, make field checks and confirm with Operations the 
Hazardous Zone Area identified on the HAC drawing. The HAC may change due to 
operational conditions e.g. due to a leaking valve or flange. 
2.6  If HAC drawings are not available, if a leak is identified, then a risk assessment 
must be conducted to determine the likely Zone Classification and mitigations.   
Speak with the Permit Issuer and DO NOT PROCEED until the Zone Classification has been 
confirmed. Check that the work location‚Äôs HAC Zone allows the planned Hot Work 
Category to be conducted. See Table 3 and Table 4 below:

Work Management Procedure 
#17 Housekeeping 
 
1 Overview and Hazards  
1.1 Housekeeping is a practical method of creating a safer workplace and reducing 
incidents by keeping the work area free of obstruction and waste. Good 
housekeeping reflects the level of professionalism and standards of its staff and it 
prevents accidents at work. 
Good housekeeping practices begin in the office and this behaviour shall extend to 
the way worksites are managed. This WMP establishes the minimum requirements 
and provides safe working practices for housekeeping. 
1.2 Hazards Include 
 ‚ñ™ Slips, trips and falls from poorly stored materials and waste / debris 
 ‚ñ™ Increased fire risk from blocked fire exit routes, flammable materials incorrectly 
stored and waste / debris 
 ‚ñ™ Damage to the environment from discarded materials, leaking fluids, poorly stored 
materials and waste / debrisîhh	uhNhèî(hhhêhNubå$9e0410da-bd94-40e6-9838-048ab9de5285îh

2.4  Housekeeping activities in process areas will be included within the permit for the task and 
/ or the Job Hazard Analysis (JHA). Team Leads and Supervisors must determine what is 
required to ensure good housekeeping during the work. They must ensure all 
team members understand their responsibility to maintain their work areas in a 
clean and orderly manner. Follow WMP #25 Permit to Work.  
2.5  Plan for storage of material, supplies and waste that considers the movement (flow) of 
personnel, equipment (e.g. Hi-ab / Bin lorry), materials, fire hazards, and clear routes for 
evacuation, firefighting and rescue as well as movement. Waste areas must be allocated 
for temporary storage/stockpiling/ segregation of materials. 
2.6  Plan for waste and debris to be removed from the work site in a timely manner.îhh	uhNhèî(hhhêhNubå$845b6a8f-3941-435f-b14b-c285c355a82bîh

#18 HSE Event Reporting, Investigation and Learning 
 
1 Overview and Hazards 
1.1 The purpose of this WMP is to ensure the correct action is taken after the occurrence of 
an HSE Event. An HSE Event is an unplanned event or chain of events that has, or could 
have, resulted in injury or illness, damage to our assets, the environment or an impact to 
our communities. 
All HSE Events including HSE incidents, Near Misses and Observations (incl unsafe 
act/conditions RAM3+) related to our activities shall be reported and investigated so that 
further risk can be mitigated, actions can be taken to prevent recurrence and to enable 
compliance with regulatory requirements and BGC standards.

#19 Hydrogen Sulphide (H2S) 
 
1  Overview and Hazards 
1.1 1
.
1 
Hydrogen Sulphide (H2S) gas is extremely hazardous. It smells like rotten eggs at low 
concentrations. It is heavier than air so accumulates in low-lying areas. H2S can be 
present in production gas and may be released through leaks or vents and drains, when 
opening or purging equipment. Table 1 summarises the health and hazardous effects of 
H2S. 
Table 1 H2S Health Effects 
OEL (ppm in air)  Health Effects  
 <1 ppm Smell like rotten eggs detectable by most people at anytime 
 10-50 ppm Burning in eyes, nose, throat, and airways. Rotten egg smell disappears 
 50-100ppm Loss of sense of smell after 15 mins,  
Up to 1 hour exposure, headaches, dizziness, loss of balance serious eye 
irritation or damage, lungs begin to fill with fluidîhh	uhNhèî(hhhêhNubå$b5dffd29-4ac5-456e-9a9c-9a1135b44242îh

Up to 1 hour exposure, headaches, dizziness, loss of balance serious eye 
irritation or damage, lungs begin to fill with fluid 
 100 ppm After 3 ‚Äì 15 mins, completely lose sense of smell, coughing, dizziness, eye 
pain and damage, difficulty breathing, drowsiness. Impair an individual‚Äôs 
ability to escape from a dangerous atmosphere. Immediately Dangerous to 
Life and Health (IDLH) level  
 200 ppm Lungs quickly fill with fluid, cannot breathe 
 >500 ppm Unconsciousness followed by death if not quickly rescued 
 >1000 ppm Breathing stops within one or two breaths, death within 3 minutes 
 
H2S Hazardous Effects 
 
 
Toxic ‚Äì creates poisonous atmospheres that cause serious illness or death 
 
Flammable ‚Äì when released to the atmosphere they can catch fire or explode 
 
 
Corrosive ‚Äì causes skin and eye damage, and can cause damage to certain materials

Inert/asphyxiating displaces oxygen from a space, making breathing impossible 
1.2 H2S in hydrocarbon systems can also cause the production of pyrophoric material (also 
known as iron sulphide or black sludge deposit). Pyrophoric material can ignite suddenly 
when exposed to air. Consider this hazard when opening equipment and dealing with 
pyrophoric sludges and scales. If H2S catches fire, it will produce sulphur dioxide, which is 
highly toxic.îhh	uhNhèî(hhhêhNubå$f66972ff-fa24-4ee6-acc2-56618760e363îh

2  Plan The Work  
2.1  Follow WMP #13 Hazard Identification to identify the hazards of the task and the 
location. Apply the Hierarchy of Controls   to ensure that the most appropriate controls 
have been selected. 
2.2  Hazard Management 
For Job Hazard Analysis (JHA) and Permit-To-Work (PTW) application:  
‚Ä¢ Identify the potential sources and concentrations of H2S  
‚Ä¢ Identify the events that might result in the release H2S 
Ensure any equipment removed from sour service must be thoroughly isolated/ 
purged/flushed to ensure no remnants of H2S are introduced during transport or in the 
workshop.  
2.3  H2S Areas (Sour Facilities) 
In BGC facilities operate either with (sour) or without risk of H2S (always verify with 
operations before you do work).îhh	uhNhèî(hhhêhNubå$487d3959-ae86-4d61-8490-c59932f7b1bfîh

2.3  H2S Areas (Sour Facilities) 
In BGC facilities operate either with (sour) or without risk of H2S (always verify with 
operations before you do work).  
‚Ä¢ Classification of H2S Area may change if sampling confirms H2S exceeds thresholds. 
‚Ä¢ Place clear warning signs and barriers at the entrance and surrounding H2S risk areas. 
 
2.4  Access Control and entry requirements to H2S Risk Areas 
Personnel planning to access BGC hydrocarbon facilities with H2S must go through the 
normal site orientation process. Area Owners must ensure processes are in place in their 
area of authority that:  
‚Ä¢ Access control is in place to stop personnel not meeting below requirements 
‚Ä¢ Personnel are informed about H2S presence and emergency response requirement 
‚Ä¢ Validity of their training is verified (see Table 2)

Work Management Procedure 
#20 Isolations 
 
1 Overview and Hazards 
 Process Isolations are part of BGC‚ÄôS Permit-To-Work (PTW) system and 
are controlled by an Isolation Confirmation Certificate (ICC) which shall be 
in place prior to start of work. The intent of an isolation and Lock \Out Tag 
out system is to minimize the risk to people, the environment and assets from exposure 
to energy (pressure, electrical, kinetic, temperature, etc) and hazardous substances 
during invasive maintenance, through effective isolation of equipment and the 
placement of locks and tags. For all types of isolations (e.g., electrical and mechanical / 
piping) systems / equipment being isolated must be tested to verify zero energy (test to 
verify dead) by both the person applying the initial locks / isolations and tags and theîhh	uhNhèî(hhhêhNubå$74cb2a96-d31b-42af-bcdc-85360aae9fefîh

verify dead) by both the person applying the initial locks / isolations and tags and the 
persons who will be carrying out the work on such equipment / systems.  
 
  
This WMP is not for: 
‚Ä¢ Portable equipment with flexible wiring and a plug under complete control of one 
person; 
‚Ä¢ Testing of energized electrical equipment or other electrical work. 
 Examples of energy or hazardous substances are: 
‚Ä¢ Gas or liquids under pressure; 
‚Ä¢ Flammable or toxic substances; 
‚Ä¢ Extreme hot or cold temperatures; 
‚Ä¢ Stored energy in equipment (e.g. under tension, locked in pressure); 
‚Ä¢ Mechanical energy from moving internal parts; 
‚Ä¢ Electricity; 
‚Ä¢ Kinetic energy from being struck by a moving object; 
‚Ä¢ Ionizing radiation.

2  Roles and Responsibilities  
2.1  The isolation and Reinstatement process have the following Authorized Person Roles: 
‚Ä¢ Isolation Owner (IO); 
‚Ä¢ Isolation Supervisor ((IS); 
‚Ä¢ Isolation Manager (IM). 
2.2  The IO will be the main focal point for isolations for BGC staff and contractors who 
execute activities as the Person In Charge of Work Site (PICWS).  
 
The responsibilities for an IO are: 
‚Ä¢ To define the scope of the isolation and undertake a risk assessment to determine 
the minimum level of isolation required, based on the Isolation Selector Tool; 
‚Ä¢ To develop an isolation and a de-isolation plan to provide the minimum level of 
isolation required or mitigates the risk to As Low as Reasonably Practicable (ALARP);  
‚Ä¢ To execute the authorized isolation as per the agreed isolation scheme, to apply 
locks and tags;îhh	uhNhèî(hhhêhNubå$de910af1-8986-43f6-acc6-e1de13f2b107îh

‚Ä¢ To execute the authorized isolation as per the agreed isolation scheme, to apply 
locks and tags; 
‚Ä¢ To monitor isolations that are live (in place), including checking pressure build up via 
local gauge; 
‚Ä¢ To de-isolate the equipment when authorized to do so by the IS. 
  
3  Requirements 
3.1  In BGC the Safe Isolation 8 Step Process is applied and is shown in Figure 1. 
3.2  The only exemption from this process is the personal isolation.  
The personal isolation can be defined as an isolation conducted under the exclusive 
management of the person servicing or maintaining the equipment and it does not add 
value to plan and manage the isolation under a full isolation certificate.  
A personal isolation can only be applied if the following conditions are met:

Work Management Procedure 
#22 Management of Change (MOC) 
 
1 Overview and Hazards 
1.1 This WMP describes the MOC process as applied in BGC Operating Asset. MOC is the 
process to manage risks introduced by changes. A change refers to a planned action or 
intervention that modifies the function of any item or process on a temporary or 
permanent basis. MOC processes for other activities (e.g. Projects, Document 
Management, Organisational Changes, etc.) will be controlled separately from this 
WMP. 
 
The purpose of this WMP is to provide all BGC staff and contractor employees with 
information on how to mitigate risks that may result from a change and ensure:  
‚Ä¢ All risks introduced by changes are identified  
‚Ä¢ The required mitigations are defined and implemented 
‚Ä¢ The residual risk is assessed and acceptedîhh	uhNhèî(hhhêhNubå$dbb184ac-c87d-4d09-afe7-0c2632e5521fîh

  h}î(hhhKêuhX"  ‚Ä¢ All risks introduced by changes are identified  
‚Ä¢ The required mitigations are defined and implemented 
‚Ä¢ The residual risk is assessed and accepted 
‚Ä¢ Secondary changes (such as Document updates, trainings, other changes required 
 to  systems as Corporate Maintenance Management System (CMMS) are identified 
 and implemented 
Every MOC should comply to the DEM2 and relevant industrial best practices. Before 
energizing and/or introducing hydrocarbons to any modification, the appropriate 
authorization should be given. Depending on the extend of the change this may be with 
‚Äú5 question before authorisation‚Äù or a Prestart-up Safety Review/Statement of Fitness 
(PSSR/SoF).  The boundaries between the P&E and asset MOC processes are shown in 
Figure 1 below:

1.2 Hazards of not correctly applying MOC 
 Inappropriate or ineffective MOC 
can lead to significant incidents, 
including; 
1. Hydrocarbon releases; 
2. Fires; 
3. Explosions;  
4. Electrocution; 
5. Failure of safety-critical 
systems. 
Lack of effective MoC has been a major 
contribution to escalation of incidents in the 
industry such as: 
1. Bhopal (1984) ‚Äì Operationally out of services 
 (safety) systems; 
2. Chernobyl (1986) ‚Äì Unauthorized change of test 
 run / operating procedures; 
3. Piper alpha (1988) ‚Äì Fireproof refugees impacted 
 after changes; 
4. Texas City (2005) - Overfill scenario and impact on 
 isolations missed after change.

Detailed 
Solution 
If an MOC is approved in principle but further engineering is required, it can be decided to 
support the MOC for Detailed Solution. Note this should only be done when this is an 
active working priority with commitments already made. Threats or opportunities should 
be kept in the asset repository until actual resources are dedicated to it and startup is 
within 1 year.

MOC can go live, all outstanding Mitigations and Implementation Actions  ‚ÄòReq for Go Live‚Äô 
must be completed.

variations are done in a controlled way. 
‚Ä¢ The authorizer confirms the readiness review has been successful and that energy (in 
the form of pressure/flow/temperature/electricity) and/or hydrocarbons can be 
introduced. To do this he/she should be able to answer at least the following five 
questions or follow PSSR/Statement of Fitness (SOF) depending on the extent of the 
change as defined in OMP.

be closed. In the case of a temporary change the pre-change situation must be re-instated 
or a permanent change carried out before the temporary change can be closed out. 
Look back When thought necessary, the MOC panel can select MOCs for a retrospective review (post 
implementation review) to verify whether the change delivered what was intended. This is 
likely to only apply to large scale changes. Learnings captured from this review will be used 
as input for the overall performance review of the MOC system. 
2.7  Additional Types of MOCs 
 Temporary Changes 
‚Ä¢ Changes which will eventually be removed, are called temporary changes. Temporary 
changes will follow the same process as permanent changes. They have a planned removal 
date and require a new review and approval if installation exceeds the planned removal date.îhh	uhNhèî(hhhêhNubå$a2b9f955-8519-4a2b-8b37-6b8c60df6410îh

date and require a new review and approval if installation exceeds the planned removal date. 
‚Ä¢ In case a temporary MOC is requested, the requestor should indicate how the temporary 
nature of the change can be eliminated with a normalization plan. The normalization plan is 
one of the two following: 
o Return to normal; 
o Extend as permanent with additional requirements. 
‚Ä¢ The MOC should confirm if there are any operating limitations or not. Mitigations to a 
temporary situation may include an operating instruction, additional inspection intervals and 
others. 
‚Ä¢ Temporary changes are not expected to be valid for more than 12 months. Temporary 
changes may be extended once by the same reviewers and approver(s). Second and 
following extensions require approval from the Asset Services Director. 
‚Ä¢ Temporary MOC request Owners shall be tracking their requests, and if there isîhh	uhNhèî(hhhêhNubå$1f080bb0-2c5c-4d10-acdf-171d55e31a1cîh

‚Ä¢ Temporary MOC request Owners shall be tracking their requests, and if there is 
a requirement to extend an MOC, they shall do it timely at least two weeks 
before the original expiry date. An overdue MOC is a Process Safety 
Fundamental (PSF) violation. 
‚Ä¢ A MOC may be required for Overrides, for details please refer to WMP #28 Safety System 
Isolation and Override Control.  
‚Ä¢ Temporary changes include: 
o Temporary equipment; 
o Occupied temporary portable facilities. PSBR1 assessment by Technical Safety 
Engineering (TSE) TA shall be completed as part of MOC supporting documents; 
o Temporary repairs. 
‚Ä¢ Overrides, if duration is more than 12 months. Refer to WMP #28 Safety 
System Isolation and Override Control.

 Emergency Change (exceptional circumstances only) 
‚Ä¢ In the circumstance where the time constraint is such that the MOC process cannot be 
followed in full as there is an immediate danger to life or health or a condition that may 
result in severe impact to the environment or imminent equipment damage an emergency 
change may be requested. 
‚Ä¢ Emergency change must be approved by the Asset Services Director or on-call delegate. 
Approval will only be granted once a hazard analyses and risk assessment has been carried 
out. 
‚Ä¢ The Approver will determine the timeline for the emergency change without formal MOC 
approval. In case the emergency change exceeds 24 hours a formal extension will need to be 
requested. The extension may be granted by the Asset Services Director. An emergency 
change may be extended max. two times. 
‚Ä¢ A formal MOC must be initiated once the organization has retained control of the situation.îhh	uhNhèî(hhhêhNubå$a8f8a35e-498e-4483-8f4f-905d6a3385c5îh

Work Management Procedure 
#23 Manual Handling 
 
1. Overview and Hazards 
1.1 Manual handling includes lifting, lowering, pushing and pulling by human effort. All BGC 
staff and contractors shall follow proper handling techniques to avoid back and hand 
injuries. Back injuries can be prevented by correct manual lifting techniques.  
 
1.2 Hazards include: 
‚Ä¢ Strained muscles and torn ligaments can occur while attempting to lift, pull or push a 
load beyond your physical capabilities; 
‚Ä¢ Hernia and slipped discs can occur by attempting to lift a load exceeding your own 
physical capabilities or by falling or slipping during the lifting or carrying operation. 
 
2.  Plan the Work 
2.1  Follow the Hierarchy of Controls for manual handling: 
Eliminate: Can we redesign the task or activity so that items don‚Äôt need to be moved or 
handled?îhh	uhNhèî(hhhêhNubå$02628217-6985-45a5-8c50-0666aef677ebîh

2.1  Follow the Hierarchy of Controls for manual handling: 
Eliminate: Can we redesign the task or activity so that items don‚Äôt need to be moved or 
handled?  
Substitute: Can we use different materials that are lighter and easier to handle?  Can we 
split the load into smaller, easier managed items? 
Engineer: Can we use mechanical aids or lifting devices to handle the load?  
E.g. trolley or lifting jib, cart, strops (ropes) and ergonomics. 
Communication: Supervision, within a work crew, verification of fitness to work. 
Avoid manual handling when there are other methods available.  
2.2  Where manual handling is still required, team leaders shall ensure, where reasonably 
practicable, appropriate equipment for lifting, lowering, pushing, pulling, carrying, 
handling or transporting heavy or awkward loads is provided to team members. 
2.3  Before any manual Handling of a load that could injure a person, he/she shall perform aîhh	uhNhèî(hhhêhNubå$a298c920-f26e-45e4-90e4-9e78b602af17îh

  h}î(hhhKöuhX  handling or transporting heavy or awkward loads is provided to team members. 
2.3  Before any manual Handling of a load that could injure a person, he/she shall perform a 
hazard assessment that considers the: 
‚Ä¢ Weight and size of the load; 
‚Ä¢ Shape of the load; 
‚Ä¢ Type of grips on the load (coupling); 
‚Ä¢ Number of times the load shall be moved; 
‚Ä¢ Route that shall be taken to move the load; 
‚Ä¢ Physical strength and capacity of the individual, including any physical limitations or 
medical conditions. 
2.4  Do not manually lift a weight that is more than 20kg, female limit 16kg.  
The maximum weight limit shall be adjusted depending on how the load is being lifted, 
how close to the body it is held, work crew size, and how high or how low the weights are 
to be lifted.îhh	uhNhèî(hhhêhNubå$aec3295f-8cab-440e-a9c2-84ce292fef08îh

load, slightly 
apart, lead foot 
slightly forward; 
‚Ä¢ Feet: in line with 
the hips to keep 
good balance; 
‚Ä¢ Knees: bend 
ready to lift by 
straightening but 
do not squat;  
‚Ä¢ Back: straight and 
rigid at all times. 
Shall not be more 
than 15 degrees 
from the vertical; 
‚Ä¢ Buttocks: push your buttocks as far back as possible. This helps your position; 
 ‚Ä¢ Arms: keep the load close to your body. Do not reach out with fully extended arms. 
Keeping the load close reduces strain and tiredness; 
‚Ä¢ Correct Grip: firmly with palms and fingers. Balance by moving your back leg as you lift 
the load. Use handles when available; 
 ‚Ä¢ Hands: always use the BGC default gloves, see WMP #26 PPE; 
‚Ä¢ Head and Chin: head raised; chin tucked in.îhh	uhNhèî(hhhêhNubå$f415664e-b77e-4d21-8db9-250c35ca52b7îh

 ‚Ä¢ Hands: always use the BGC default gloves, see WMP #26 PPE; 
‚Ä¢ Head and Chin: head raised; chin tucked in. 
3.2  Supervisors shall ensure team members involved in manual handling understand the risks 
involved and are able to demonstrate the correct manual lifting techniques. 
3.3  Do not start to manually lift a load before: 
‚Ä¢ The area is free from obstructions; 
‚Ä¢ You have done a quick weight test;  
‚Ä¢ You have found the load‚Äôs center of gravity. 
If the object to be handled is too heavy or awkward, get help. The manual lifting method 
for two or more people is the same as for one person. 
Consider similar height during manual lifting where two or more people are involved in 
carrying the heavy object. 
If the load is too heavy or difficult to lift manually, team members shall report to the team 
leader who shall provide appropriate equipment.  
3.4  Injury Prevention Controls  
‚Ä¢ Reduce distances to the loads to be handled;îhh	uhNhèî(hhhêhNubå$cc5696e8-5320-43c9-9db9-188290d227adîh

‚Ä¢ Provide the proper manual handling devices such as carts and dollies; 
‚Ä¢ Arrange to have smaller, lighter, and easier to handle load sizes; 
‚Ä¢ Suspend heavy tools from balancers to reduce the force required to hold the tool; 
‚Ä¢ Avoid standing with a heavy load; if you stop, set it down by reversing the manual 
lifting techniques;îhh	uhNhèî(hhhêhNubå$80521ccf-7b4c-4e11-8c8e-7fe421db213aîh

‚Ä¢ Do not carry a load which obstructs your view and always ensure that your line of 
travel is clear from obstructions; 
‚Ä¢ Never attempt to change your grip while carrying a load. If a change is necessary, set 
the load down on a firm support, change your grip and lift the load up again; 
‚Ä¢ Always consider the physical limitations of the individual, including age, gender, 
medical conditions, physical fitness.

Work Management Procedure 
#25 Permit To Work (PTW) 
 
1 Overview and Hazards  
1.1 BGC‚Äôs PTW is a formal documented system that manages specific work within 
BGC‚Äôs locations and activities. PTW aims to ensure Hazards and Risks are 
identified, and Controls are in place to prevent harm to People, Assets, Community, and 
the Environment (PACE). The PTW process: 
‚Ä¢ Requires proper planning and consideration of activities before permission is given to 
start work;   
‚Ä¢ Authorizes certain people to carry out specific work at a specific time and place; 
‚Ä¢ Sets out the precautions required to complete the work safely.   
1.2 An issued PTW does not mean all risks are controlled or that work is safe to proceed.  
Workers must read, understand, and follow the precautions in the PTW documents 
pack, while continuously assessing and managing risk. BGC Management expects fullîhh	uhNhèî(hhhêhNubå$97804f0e-518a-43b8-88bd-d8175b3de40cîh

‚Ä¢ Emergency arrangements specific to the site (see also WMP #04 Emergency Response) 
2.2  The BGC PTW system applies to all activities within BGC process areas (brownfield) and 
150 m either side of a buried or above ground asset. 
2.3  Pipeline Permits: 
‚Ä¢ For both intrusive and non-intrusive work on a pipeline, traps and associated piping 
inside the facilities fence boundaries the PTW will be issued/managed by the 
respective facility PTW office. A few examples of intrusive and non-intrusive work: 
o Intrusive activities are pigging & ILI inspection, valve operation (and stroking), pig 
trap door/end closure seal replacement, pipeline cut/replacement.  
o Non-intrusive work is inspection, coating removal, coating application, civil 
activities.

activities.  
‚Ä¢ For non-intrusive work on a pipeline or associated accessories (including pig trap and 
block valve stations) outside the facilities fence boundaries of 150 m the PTW will be 
issued/managed by the Pipeline team. Activities which involves welding onto a live 
pipeline (e.g. repair sleeves), the PTW will be issued/managed by the Pipeline team 
and co-signed by the relevant facilities PTW office.  The relevant facility shall ensure 
the required pressure control measures are correctly implemented and managed. 
2.4  For non-process areas, site- or activity-specific PTW systems can be developed and 
deployed, subject to approval by the BGC Director responsible for the site or activity. 
Examples Include:

3.32  PICWS is to supervise the work ensuring that controls are implemented, and that work is 
carried out safely. 
3.33  Ensure PTW pack is displayed and easily available at the work location for inspection and 
reference. 
3.34  PICWS must always be at the work location during work. The only exception to this is where 
the PICWS can effectively observe and immediately intervene on all work. PICWS is only 
permitted a max of 2 PTW‚Äôs in this exceptional case. 
3.35  If PICWS needs to leave the work site, work must be suspended, and the PTW returned to 
the PTW office. The PTW can be reissued to a new PICWS once all aspects of the activity 
have been discussed and understood.  The new PICWS must then hold a TBT as per STEP 6.îhh	uhNhèî(hhhêhNubå$85871326-545f-47ed-873d-5e6746e7c986îh

3.37  Work must PAUSE if there are any unforeseen circumstances or changes to the work site or 
work scope. Advice must then be taken on appropriate steps. PICWS is to discuss with 
Permit Issuer.  
3.38  Minor changes such as weather conditions, access arrangements, or worksite layout should 
be recorded on the TRIC card.  A TBT focusing on the changed conditions must then be 
completed. 
3.39  Major changes such as to work scope, critical controls (such as isolations), or introduction of 
additional hazards will result in PTW suspension. Work cannot continue until the PTW has 
been revised and resubmitted through the PTW meeting. 
3.40  If the work has been stopped temporarily and the PTW is pulled or returned to the PTW 
office then:

The above actions will ensure that Operations and the affected work group Supervision are 
fully informed, enabling discussions to take place to resolve the issue and / or agree further 
actions. 
3.41  If work can‚Äôt be completed by end of shift, make the area safe, and return the PTW pack to

Work Management Procedure 
#26 Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) 
  
1 Overview and Hazards 
1.1 PPE is equipment worn to reduce severity of injuries resulting from exposure to hazards 
in the workplace. 
1.2 Hazards 
Hazards in the workplace include among others chemical, radiological, physical, 
electrical, mechanical hazards as per WMP #13 Hazard identification. PPE is the least 
effective control in the Hierarchy of Controls   after hazard elimination, substitution, 
engineering and administrative controls.  
Hence PPE alone should not be relied upon to mitigate risk. 
 Relevant Life Saving Rules and Process Safety Fundamentals

2.3  Additional requirements for PPE are based on a risk 
assessment, depending on the site conditions and the 
scope and activities of the work.  
Where job conditions change, PPE selection must be 
reviewed to ensure it is still valid. See WMP #13 Hazard 
Identification. 
2.4  When specialised PPE is required (e.g. high noise, radiation, chemical storage areas, 
hydrocarbon process areas) it should be marked with prominent signage, universal 
symbols and/or in the language of the workforce to ensure that personnel are aware of 
the requirements. See also relevant WMPs specific to tasks and Hazards;  
 
2.5  Personal items with the potential to act as an ignition source are restricted from 
hydrocarbon process areas. See also WMP #13 Hazard Identification.

Work Management Procedure 
#27 Safety Signs & Barricades 
 
1 Overview and Hazards  
1.1 The purpose of this WMP is to describe the installation and maintenance of barricades, 
flagging and warning signs. 
1.2 A barricade is defined as a system designed to warn of a hazard and physically identify 
the Hazard‚Äôs parameters. Barricades (also referred to as barriers) can be ‚Äúsoft‚Äù or ‚Äúhard‚Äù, 
depending on the intended use and the nature of the hazard being protected. 
This WMP outlines the requirements for soft barricades, hard barricades, as well as 
signage which must be used in conjunction with barricades.   
All BGC staff and contractors shall be aware of the types of barricades used within the 
BGC assets and are responsible for respecting the barricades as well as following the 
conditions set within this procedure.îhh	uhNhèî(hhhêhNubå$2e02f357-d92f-43e8-8c8e-10277f1d232bîh

2  Plan The Work  
2.1  Follow WMP #13 Hazard Identification to identify the Hazards of the task and the 
location. Apply the Hierarchy of Controls to ensure that the most appropriate signs, 
barricades and controls have been selected. 
2.2  Confirm what approvals, documentation, Permit-To-Work (PTW), Job Hazard 
Analysis (JHA), ToolBox Talk (TBT), etc, is needed and who will check it is done 
before the work starts. Follow WMP #25 PTW. 
 
2.3  Where potential Hazard may exist in the work location (e.g. excavations):

Work Management Procedure 
#28 Safety System Isolation & Override Control 
 
1 Overview and Hazards 
1.1 BGC depends on an operating safeguarding system to ensure the safe operation and 
maintenance of assets. Sometimes, during maintenance, functional tests, 
equipment calibrations, and process start-up and stabilization activities, it is 
required to override a part of the safeguarding system. 
1.2 Before requesting for an override, it is very important to understand that 
overrides are only permitted when the production process is being operated 
within the design envelope. Safety Critical Equipment shall NOT be overridden 
to resolve upset conditions (trips or automated shutdowns). In this case, use stabilize, 
slow down, shutdown steps as needed.

#29 Temporary Flexible Hose Assemblies 
 
1 Overview and Hazards 
1.1 This WMP is applicable for the use of 
temporary flexible hose assemblies. Hoses 
are considered as temporary when they 
are not a fixed part of the process 
equipment or portable equipment. 
Examples of temporary hoses are: Spray 
painting hose, connection of air-powered 
tools and equipment, compressed gas 
cylinder hoses for supplementing 
construction use e.g. purging activity, utility hose to drain a vessel, chemical injection 
hose, instrument air hose, etc.  
The following are not considered to be temporary hoses: Choke and kill hoses, bunkering 
hoses, braided machinery hose in machinery utility, machinery hose within vehicles or 
cranes, hoses within snuffing system cylinders, CO2 hoses and fire water hoses

cranes, hoses within snuffing system cylinders, CO2 hoses and fire water hoses 
1.2 Hazards 
The use of flexible hose assemblies presents the following hazards: 
‚Ä¢ Loss of containment of substances (fluid and/or gas) through imperfection, leaks at 
end connection or from the punctured body of the hose; 
‚Ä¢ Sudden release of energy i.e. ruptures, parting or sudden disconnection of the hose 
leading to personnel injury, asset damage and significant loss of containment; 
‚Ä¢ Hoses improperly run on site presenting tripping hazards or subjecting the hose to 
excessive stress or abrasion; 
‚Ä¢ Static electrical discharge in hazardous areas of the plant; 
‚Ä¢ Selection of the wrong hose for the intended use (e.g., hose not suitable for the 
service pressure, temperature or fluid).

Work Management Procedure 
#31 Work at Height (WAH) 
 
1 Overview and Hazards 
1.1 WAH is any activity where there is a risk of injury from falling or Dropped Objects 
where this a fall distance of 1.8 meters (6 feet) or more from any working level.  
This WMP describes the requirements to prevent injuries from falls or dropped objects 
when accessing or working at height.  
Work or access outside an approved fixed work platform equipped with fixed guard rails 
requires a WAH certificate and additional specific controls and equipment.  
This WMP covers the requirements prior to, during and after the completion of any work 
involving access and working at heights on fixed structures, scaffolds, Mobile Elevated 
Work Platforms (MEWP), ladders, delta decks or mobile and access towers.

3  Do The Work 
3.1  Personal Fall Arrest 
A fall arrest system minimally 
includes (A-B-C); Anchorage, 
Body support and Connecting 
device. The anchorage is 
normally a stable point where a 
connecting device is attached 
with the other end attaching to a 
lanyard and harness.  
      Figure 3 Personal Arrest System  
3.2  Before use, workers must visually inspect fall protection equipment. Any deficiency 
found means works must be paused and the supervisor shall be informed, see checklist 
Appendix 1.  
3.3  Fall protection equipment must be used only for worker protection and must not be 
used for the movement of materials. 
3.4  Except for during erecting and dismantling scaffolds, anchorage points used for 
attachment of fall protection components shall be independent of any anchorage being 
used to support or suspend platforms and capable of supporting at least 2,268Kg perîhh	uhNhèî(hhhêhNubå$a36dda5f-1489-458b-bc9a-57c7d527ecbeîh

used to support or suspend platforms and capable of supporting at least 2,268Kg per 
person attached to it.   
3.5  Anchor points shall not be used to anchor multiple lifelines. 
3.6  Working alone while using a personal fall arrest system shall not be permitted. 
3.7  Personal fall arrest systems shall not be attached to a guardrail system (e.g. gantry 
handrails) or to a hoist not designed for personnel lifts. 
3.8  Fall arrest devices (inertia reels etc.) shall be placed directly above the worker to prevent 
pendulum falls. The maximum recommended deviation of the wire from the vertical is 
30 deg. This means that the worker should always be working in a 60-deg. cone. 
3.9  Lanyards, vertical lifelines, and body harnesses shall meet standards as per WMP #26 
PPE. Except for working from MEWP, only shock absorbing lanyards shall be used.  Forîhh	uhNhèî(hhhêhNubå$e3956fd5-52d3-4937-a869-c8abfeca794eîh

work from MEWP, restraining harness shall be used and are mandatory immediately on 
entering the work basket. 
3.10  Personal fall arrest systems and components subjected to a significant fall or full load 
shall be immediately removed from service and not used again until the equipment has 
been inspected and determined to be undamaged and suitable for reuse. However,

3.14  When it is impractical to use a lanyard, a rope grab system can be used on a vertical 
lifeline. 
3.15  When vertical lifelines are used, each worker shall be attached to a separate lifeline. 
3.16  Horizontal lifelines shall be designed, installed, and used, under the supervision of the 
Area Engineer as part of a complete fall arrest system. 
3.17  Dee-rings and snap hooks shall have a minimum tensile strength of at least 2,268 kg 
(5,000 pounds). They shall be purchased with certification showing proof-test to a 
minimum tensile load of 1,633 kg (3,600 pounds) without cracking, breaking or taking 
permanent deformation.

3.19  Free Fall Distance & Swing Falls 
Personal fall arrest systems must be selected and rigged to ensure that potential free fall 
distances will never exceed 1.8m.  
‚Ä¢ Total fall distance is the sum of free fall distance and deceleration distance; 
‚Ä¢ Dynamic elongation of the system (temporary elastic stretch of connecting 
components and subsystems) and the worker‚Äôs height must be added to total fall 
distance and the user must allow for clearance;îhh	uhNhèî(hhhêhNubå$819f55c1-911f-4a45-8c97-039581eb3b61îh

‚Ä¢ It is prudent to allow for an additional safety factor of 1m below the fallen worker‚Äôs 
feet. 
Figure 5 Free Fall Distance & Swing Falls 
 
3.20  Swing falls can occur when the system is 
not anchored directly above the user.  
The force of striking an object in a pendular 
motion can cause serious injury.  
Always minimize swingfalls by working as 
directly below the anchorage point as 
possible.

‚Ä¢ Ladders must extend a minimum of 1050mm above the working platform.  
Any opening (other than access points) shall be enclosed by means of guardrails / 
toe-boards to stop any potential risk of a fall or dropped objects;  
‚Ä¢ Where reasonably practicable ladders must be enclosed by means of double 
guardrails at the top of the access point that provides additional edge protection;  
‚Ä¢ The intermediate guardrail and toe board must be omitted on the inboard side 
adjacent to the ladder to permit clear access to the working platform. Swing gates 
are the preferred method of gaining access and egress from ladders;

3.28  Scaffolding Inspection 
‚Ä¢ All scaffolding shall use a tag type tagging system. A ‚ÄúDO NOT USE‚Äù tag (typically 
RED) is used for restricting access by scaffolders only until the scaffolding has been 
inspected and handed over for use.  
‚Ä¢ The green tag shall be completed and located at all the access points by the 
competent scaffolding personnel to validate scaffold for use.  
‚Ä¢ Inspection of scaffold shall take place at least every 7 days or after any event likely 
to have affected the scaffold‚Äôs stability and recorded in the scaffold register. The 
tag type insert will also be updated to record the inspection.îhh	uhNhèî(hhhêhNubå$1946eb4b-0b84-4f9f-a02b-fa8c1ab48eccîh

‚Ä¢ Fall protection equipment is not required when working on green tags scaffolds.   
‚Ä¢ All personnel must wear fall protection and 100% tie off when erecting and 
dismantling of scaffolding.   
 
3.29  Any work on an incomplete scaffold or requiring a work location outside the guard rail 
of a completed scaffold shall require fall protection and 100% tie-off. Do not remove 
the Green Tag unless it‚Äôs for safety. Inform the Scaffolding Lead or Scaffolding Inspector
